AB In this paper, we develop a Vietnamese Question Answering system to answer simple questions about provisions, processes, procedures, and sanctions in law on enterprises Vietnam. Research to build a Vietnamese Question Answering system is more difficult than English Question Answering system because of lack of Vietnamese processing resources and tools, or their results isn't high. We have utilized available Vietnamese resources, tools and modified some tools (such as Lucene) and algorithms, which worked well in English, applies in Vietnamese. From that, we have proposed a similarity-based model to build a Vietnamese Question Answering system in Vietnam's legal documents, namely vLawyer system. In experimental section, we achieved promising result, about 70% precision in legal documents, it proved that our approach is reasonable in legal document domain.

TI EXTRACTING FACTS FROM CASE RULINGS THROUGH PARAGRAPH SEGMENTATION OF
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (NLDB 2021)
DE Legal document; Text classification; Text segmentation
AB In order to justify rulings, legal documents need to present facts as well as an analysis built thereon. In this paper, we present two methods to automatically extract case-relevant facts from French-language legal documents pertaining to tenant-landlord disputes. Our models consist of an ensemble that classifies a given sentence as either Fact or non-Fact, regardless of its context, and a recurrent architecture that contextually determines the class of each sentence in a given document. Both models are combined with a heuristic-based segmentation system that identifies the optimal point in the legal text where the presentation of facts ends and the analysis begins. When tested on a dataset of rulings from the Regie du Logement of the city of ANONYMOUS, the recurrent architecture achieves a better performance than the sentence ensemble classifier. The fact segmentation task produces a splitting index which can be weighted in order to favour shorter segments with few instances of non-facts or longer segments that favour the recall of facts. Our best configuration successfully segments 40% of the dataset within a single sentence of offset with respect to the gold standard. An analysis of the results leads us to believe that the commonly accepted assumption that, in legal documents, facts should precede the analysis is often not followed.

AB We present a proof of concept for using automated text analytic techniques to extract key information from lengthy B2B legal documents using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a machine learning-based natural language-processing framework. Our methodological contributions overcome the text length limitations of applying BERT to long legal documents. We identify franchise disclosure documents (FDDs) as an initial use case for these methodologies and a fruitful avenue for further exploration. From FDDs, we successfully extract answers to questions about firm structure, contractual obligations, finances, and litigation disclosures while also overcoming the technical challenges of applying BERT to large bodies of text. Questionand-answer techniques such as these, deployed in a B2B context, potentially can increase transparency and clarity for prospective exchange partners, addressing concerns in the literature about legal document readability and associated problems of information asymmetry and disclosure misunderstanding. Our discussion identifies promising contexts and an agenda for future scholarship focused on question-and-answer in B2B research.

ID RESOLUTION
AB Legal and regulatory texts are ubiquitous and important in our life. Automated processing of such documents using natural language processing and information retrieval techniques is desired. Many legal text processing problems require information extraction as a base component. In this paper, we address the task of extracting references from law and regulatory documents, which are necessary for recognition of the relations between documents and document parts, and other problems. We formulate the task as a sequence labeling problem and introduce several extraction models, consisting of both traditional (conditional random fields) and more advanced (deep neural networks) methods. In addition to features learned by deep networks, we investigate various types of manually engineered features that reflect the characteristics of legal documents. Our best model that combines bidirectional long short-term memory networks and conditional random fields achieves 95.35% in the F-1 score on a corpus consisting of more than 11 thousand sentences from Vietnamese law and regulatory documents.

AB This work describes a Shallow Question Answering System (QAS) restricted to legal documents. This system returns a set of relevant articles extracted from several regulation documents. The set of relevant articles allows inferring answers to questions posed in natural language. We take the approach of representing the set of all the articles as a graph: the question is split in two parts (called A and B), and each of them is added as part of the graph. Then several paths are constructed from part A of the question to pail B, so that the shortest path contains the relevant articles to the question. We evaluate our method comparing the answers given by a traditional information retrieval system-vector space model adjusted for article retrieval, instead of document retrieval-and the answers to 21 questions given manually by the general lawyer of the National Polytechnic Institute, based on 26 different regulations (academy regulation, scholarships regulation, postgraduate studies regulation, etc.); with the answer of our system based on the same set of regulations. The results show that our system performs twice as better with regard to the traditional Information Retrieval model for Question Answering.

We compared Binary Bag of Words, Bag of Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Word2vec and Doc2vec models in different dimensions and with different hyperparameters, totaling 45 models. Our experiment consists in evaluating the result of clustering done by K-Means algorithm over the vectors created by each model. The evaluation was done both quantitatively, using clustering evaluation metrics, and qualitatively, considering relevant aspects for the application of this type of algorithm in the legal environment, such as transparency and interpretability. Our experiments were conducted in a database of 30,000 documents in Brazilian Portuguese of judicial moves of the Tribunal de Justica do Rio Grande do Norte (TJRN). The research results suggest that the TF-IDF method seems to be the most suitable for the task, outperforming the other models in considered metrics. The other methods appear to perform equally well, with the exception of Doc2vec, which performed poorly.

AB Previous work has shown that modeling relationships between articles of a regulation as vertices of a graph network works twice as better than traditional information retrieval systems for returning articles relevant to the question. In this work we experiment by using natural language techniques such as lemmatizing and using manual and automatic thesauri for improving question based document retrieval. For the construction of the graph, we follow the approach of representing the set of all the articles as a graph; the question is split in two parts, and each of them is added as part of the graph. Then several paths are constructed from part A of the question to part 13, so that the shortest path contains the relevant articles to the question. We evaluate our method comparing the answers given by a traditional information retrieval system-vector space model adjusted for article retrieval. instead of document retrieval-and the answers to 21 questions given manually by the general lawyer of the National Polytechnic Institute. based on 25 different regulations (academy regulation, scholarships regulation, postgraduate studies regulation, etc.); with the answer of our system based on the same set of regulations.

AB Text mining techniques have been widely used to process large volumes of documents. However, there is still a large gap when defining the architecture for systems with transactional elements of computational intelligence. The aim of the paper is to outline a proposed architecture to build a computational system that uses text mining techniques to index content from the database of the Official Gazette in the city of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim in the state of Espirito Santo, transforming the information previously available in natural language into a structured format that can be persisted. To validate the architecture we developed a prototype in Java accessible in the Web environment to evaluate the tool. To evaluate the tool, a case study featured a database composed of 22 documents, containing 198 normative acts from the database of the Official Gazette, in which good levels of accuracy and coverage of information retrieval were identified. This study contributes to the presentation of a hybrid architecture consisting of components of the model of transactional systems and elements of text mining, in addition to the use of software design patterns.

Based on these observations, the present work discusses how the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods may harvest valuable knowledge about citizen-government communication in user profiling and satisfaction inference tasks. More specifically, from a large text dataset of this kind, we build a number of models using a range of supervised machine learning methods - including bidirectional long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), pre-trained context-sensitive embeddings (BERT) and others - and show that these outperform textual and non-textual baseline alternatives alike. This outcome makes a case in favour of NLP methods for these tasks, and paves the way for further applications in the public information access domain.

Major advances in biomedical informatics have made natural language processing (NLP) of medical texts both a realistic and useful task. Biomedical NLP tools are typically designed to process documents originating from biomedical libraries or electronic health records (EHRs). The usefulness of biomedical NLP tools on texts authored outside of EHRs is unclear, despite an abundance of medicolegal documents existing at the intersection of medicine and law. In particular, we detail our experiences processing unstructured text and extracting semantic concepts using case investigation notes; these notes were authored by trained investigative professionals working in a medical examiner's office and describe cases containing deaths related to fatal opioid poisonings. Applying NLP to case notes is a particularly important step in generalizing the advances of biomedical NLP for other related domains and giving guidance to data scientists working with unstructured data generated outside of EHRs.

AB This paper provides an overview of machine learning models, as compared to traditional economic models. It also lays out emerging issues in law and economics that the machine learning methodology raises. In doing so, Asian contexts are considered. Law and economics scholarship has applied econometric models for statistical inferences, but law as social engineering often requires forward-looking predictions rather than retrospective inferences. Machine learning can be used as an alternative or supplementary tool to improve the accuracy of legal prediction by controlling out-of-sample variance along with in-sample bias and by fitting diverse models to data with non-linear or otherwise complex distribution. In the legal arena, the past experience of using economic models in antitrust and other high-stakes litigation provides a clue as to how to introduce artificial intelligence into the legal decision-making process. Law and economics is also expected to provide useful insights as to how to balance the development of the artificial intelligence technology with fundamental social values such as human rights and autonomy.

Just as when a member of the public telephones his city's helpline he wants a single response to his question, a web tool which tries to emulate this service also needs to be precise, ideally providing only one response. To achieve this objective, in this paper we present a search engine which offers precise information to the public, allowing them to ask questions in the language with which they are most comfortable, without (his affecting the quality of the service provided.

AB The knowledge graph was first used in the information search of the Internet as a way to improve the quality of the search because it contains a huge amount of structured knowledge data. In this paper, the knowledge map algorithm is studied through natural language processing technology and probabilistic fuzzy information aggregation, and the knowledge map completion algorithm is cognitive-fitted. NLP is natural language processing. Based on the experiments in this paper, it can be seen that, after combining the algorithm, the behavior data set of 1000 Amazon users was analyzed, and it can be found that the accuracy of the algorithm improves as the proportion of data in the experiment increases. Among them, the 10% dataset has a correct rate of 0.66; the 30% dataset has a final accuracy rate of 0.68; and the 50% dataset has a final accuracy rate of 0.70. The experimental results of this paper show that using probabilistic fuzzy information aggregation and natural language processing technology as a way to complete the knowledge graph can improve the accuracy of the operation. It plays an important role in the development of intelligent cognition and search engines.

AB Emotion analysis has been attracting researchers' attention. Most previous works in the artificial-intelligence field focus on recognizing emotion rather than mining the reason why emotions are not or wrongly recognized. The correlation among emotions contributes to the failure of emotion recognition. In this article, we try to fill the gap between emotion recognition and emotion correlation mining through natural language text from Web news. The correlation among emotions, expressed as the confusion and evolution of emotion, is primarily caused by human emotion cognitive bias. To mine emotion correlation from emotion recognition through text, three kinds of features and two deep neural-network models are presented. The emotion confusion law is extracted through an orthogonal basis. The emotion evolution law is evaluated from three perspectives: one-step shift, limited-step shifts, and shortest path transfer. The method is validated using three datasets: 1) the titles; 2) the bodies; and 3) the comments of news articles, covering both objective and subjective texts in varying lengths (long and short). The experimental results show that in subjective comments, emotions are easily mistaken as anger. Comments tend to arouse emotion circulations of love-anger and sadness-anger. In objective news, it is easy to recognize text emotion as love and cause fear-joy circulation. These findings could provide insights for applications regarding affective interaction, such as network public sentiment, social media communication, and human-computer interaction.

AB Zipf's law is a mathematically relatively simple formula stating that the frequency of a word is inversely correlated with its rank. Zipf's law is well-known in computational linguistics and cognitive sciences alike. In the context of agent development, however, Zipf's law has hardly ever been mentioned. This is surprising as principles regarding language likely benefit the development of conversational agents. This paper serves as a starting point to explore the role of Zipf's law in agent development, showing that Zipf's law also applies to dialog. Moreover, it can shed light on human-machine dialog. In addition to word frequency distributions that demonstrate Zipf's law, we also included frequency distributions of words at specific positions in the sentence as well as turn lengths. Zipf's law was found in the far majority of analyses we conducted. In addition, we investigated whether Zipf's law can be used to detect differences between human and agent-generated speech through correlating the distributions and found that even though both the human and agent frequency distributions follow Zipf's law, these distributions are not necessarily similar, shedding light on where agent dialog may distinguish itself from human dialog. The findings in this paper can thus serve as a way to monitor to what extent ubiquitous patterns in human-human dialog are found in human-machine dialog.

Public administration, with the final objective of contributing to appropriate consolidation of an intelligent administration which can continue to be efficient, personalised, electronic and a guarantee of citizenship rights, is progressively incorporating this technology in public services. These intelligent tools have a great capacity for improving the provision of public services, to the extent that they can process natural language or analyse high quantities of data in order to help in making public decisions, among other functions. This new administration, together with this potential of great improvements in administrative activity, is accompanied at the same time by a series of risks with a clear legal and ethical dimension. As a result, the required technological progress for the improvement of public services can come into conflict with legal security, with basic rights such as equality at the present time, privacy or the protection of personal data, or with the principles or obligations of administrative conduct; for example, the obligation of motivation, transparency or the efficiency of defence or appeal law, as it will not always be possible to know the reason for the results given by some forms of artificial intelligence. Among other regulatory challenges that need to be addressed from the point of view of administrative law, it is possible to highlight in its principal aims the range of transparency (algorithmical), the suitable motivation for decisions assisted by artificial intelligences, and responsibility in the event of damages occasioned by following or by not being aware of the results provided by algorism.

AB Rationale: Detecting users at risk of suicide in text-based counseling services is essential to ensure that at-risk individuals are flagged and prioritized. Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a domain knowledge-aware risk assessment (KARA) model to improve our ability of suicide detection in online counseling systems. Methods: We obtained the largest known de-identified dataset from an emotional support system established in Hong Kong, comprising 5682 Cantonese conversations between help-seekers and counselors. Of those, 682 conversations disclosed crisis intentions of suicide. We constructed a suicide-knowledge graph, representing suicide-related domain knowledge as a computer-processible graph. Such knowledge graph was embedded into a deep learning model to improve its ability to identify help-seekers in crisis. As the baseline, a standard NLP model was applied to the same task. 80% of the study samples were randomly sampled to train model parameters. The remaining 20% were used for model validation. Evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and c-statistic were reported. Results: Both KARA and the baseline achieved high precision (0.984 and 0.951, shown in Table 2) and high recall (0.942 and 0.947) towards non-crisis cases. For crisis cases, however, KARA model achieved a much higher recall than the baseline (0.870 vs 0.791). The c-statistics of KARA and the baseline were 0.815 and 0.760, respectively. Conclusion: KARA significantly outperformed standard NLP models, demonstrating good translational value and clinical relevance.

Hence, this paper explores what strategies of use local governments are employing to create content on social media. To do so, our study re-elaborates a well-known interpretative framework of social media interactions in the public sector, regarding three categories: providing information, citizen interaction and public service delivery. By analysing Twitter data through machine-learning automated natural language processing, we test the framework studying posted content from a leading group of European city councils. Our conclusions confirm the utilisation of social media to provide institutional information or foster interactions with citizens. At the same time, European local governments are also starting to use social media for public service delivery.

AB The Internet and the development of the semantic web have created the opportunity to provide structured legal data on the web. However, most legal information is in text. It is difficult to automatically determine the right natural language answer about the law to a given natural language question. One approach is to develop systems of legal ontologies and rules. Our example ontology represents semantic information about USA criminal law and procedure as well as the applicable legal rules. The purpose of the ontology is to provide reasoning support to an legal question answering tool that determines entailment between a pair of texts, one known as the Background information (Bg) and the other Question statement (Q), whether Bg entails Q based on the application of the law. The key contribution of this paper is a clear and well-structured methodology that serves to develop such criminal law ontologies and rules (CLOR).

The open-source framework RASA is used to implement the system in our study. We aim to improve our model performance by replacing parts of RASA's default tokenizers with Vietnamese tokenizers and experimenting with various language models. The best accuracy we achieved is 86.48% and 70.04% in the ideal condition and worst condition, respectively. Finally, we put our findings into practice by creating an Android virtual assistant application using the model trained using Whitespace tokenizer and the pre-trained language m-BERT.

TI BEYOND TRANSPARENCY: THE SEMANTICS OF RULEMAKING FOR AN OPEN INTERNET
SO INDIANA LAW JOURNAL
ID NET NEUTRALITY; ANTITRUST
AB In trying to promote the development of an open Internet, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has primarily tried to encourage network providers to be transparent about their traffic management practices and quality of service prioritization policies. Dominant network operators have successfully challenged this minimalist approach to addressing end-user concerns about the rise of a two-tiered Internet, motivating the FCC to engage in yet another public consultation process to assess its future approach to the problem. This article maps the debate using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools that allow us to build a systematic picture of the positions of the regulator and groups of private interests trying to shape its decisions. A quantitative linguistic analysis of the content of formal written submissions to the FCC by parties with divergent views helps document how the conceptual model of the regulator evolved during the rulemaking process leading to the FCC February 2015 network neutrality Order. Despite the adoption of a broader substantive basis by the FCC under Title II of the Communications Act, the rule-of-reason approach to substantive interpretation in the Order limits the capacity of the new regulatory framework to protect and promote an open Internet. The evidence suggests the public consultation process is likely to serve as a tool for legitimizing status quo institutional arrangements that allow operators to engage in discriminatory traffic prioritization strategies.

AB This paper presents a corpus of pre-processed Mexican laws for computational tasks. The main contributions are the proposed JSON structure and the methodology used to achieve the semi-structured corpus with the selected algorithms. Law PDF documents were transformed into plain text, unified by a deconstruction of law-document structure, and labeled with natural language processing techniques considering part of speech (PoS); a process of entity extraction was also performed. The corpus includes the Mexican constitution and the Mexican laws that were collected from the official site in PDF format repealed before 14 October 2021. The collection has 305 documents, including: the Mexican constitution, 289 laws, 8 federal codes, 3 regulations, 2 statutes, 1 decree, and 1 ordinance. The semi-structured database includes the transformation of the set of laws from PDF format to a digital representation in order to facilitate its computational analysis. The documents were migrated to JSON type files to represent internal hierarchical relations. In addition, basic natural language processing techniques were implemented on laws for the identification of part of speech and named entities. The presented data set is mainly useful for text analysis and data science. It could be used for various legislative analysis tasks including: comprehension, interpretation, translation, classification, accessibility, coherence, and searches. Finally, we present some statistic of the identified entities and an example of the usefulness of the corpus for environmental laws.

His objections rely on Leibniz's Law and linguistic environments that appear to be immune to the standard charge of non-transparency and substitution failure. In this paper, I respond to Fine's objections on behalf of the monist. Following Schnieder (Philosophical Quarterly 56:39-54, 2006), I observe that arguments from Leibniz's Law are valid only if they involve descriptive, rather than metalinguistic, negation. Then I show that the monist is justified in treating the negation in Fine's objections as metalinguistic in nature. Along the way I make a few methodological remarks about the interaction between the study of natural language and metaphysics. I also present evidence that some of the linguistic environments which Fine relies on are, contrary to appearances, non-transparent.

However, searching and navigating these multi-source, multi-modal, and often unstructured data to extract useful information is still a relatively challenging task. Therefore, the LSC2019 competition has been organized so that researchers can demonstrate novel search engines, as well as exchange ideas and collaborate on these types of problems.

ID STREET PROSTITUTION; NOXIOUS FACILITIES; FEMALE PROSTITUTES;
AB Prostitution has been a topic of study for decades, yet many questions remain about where prostitution occurs. Difficulty in identifying prostitution activity is often attributed to the hidden and seemingly victimless nature of the crime. Despite numerous challenges associated with policing street prostitution, these encounters become more difficult to identify when they take place indoors, especially in locations away from public view, such as hotels. The purpose of this paper is to develop a strategy for identifying hotel facilities and surrounding areas that may be experiencing elevated levels of prostitution activity using high-volume, user-generated data, namely hotel reviews written by guests and posted to Travelocity.com. A unique synthesis of methods including data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and basic spatial analysis are combined to identify facilities that may require additional law enforcement resources and/or social/health service outreach. Prostitution hotspots are identified within the city of Phoenix, Arizona and policy implications are discussed.

ID BIG DATA
AB Big data analytics can be used by smart cities to improve their citizens' liveability, health, and wellbeing. Social surveys and also social media can be employed to engage with their communities, and these can require sophisticated analysis techniques. This research was focused on carrying out a sentiment analysis from social surveys. Data analysis techniques using RStudio and Python were applied to several open-source datasets, which included the 2018 Social Indicators Survey dataset published by the City of Melbourne (CoM) and the Casey Next short survey 2016 dataset published by the City of Casey (CoC). The qualitative nature of the CoC dataset responses could produce rich insights using sentiment analysis, unlike the quantitative CoM dataset. RStudio analysis created word cloud visualizations and bar charts for sentiment values. These were then used to inform social media analysis via the Twitter application programming interface. The R codes were all integrated within a Shiny application to create a set of user-friendly interactive web apps that generate sentiment analysis both from the historic survey data and more immediately from the Twitter feeds. The web apps were embedded within a website that provides a customisable solution to estimate sentiment for key issues. Global sentiment was also compared between the social media approach and the 2016 survey dataset analysis and showed some correlation, although there are caveats on the use of social media for sentiment analysis. Further refinement of the methodology is required to improve the social media app and to calibrate it against analysis of recent survey data.

DE semantic role labelling; part-of-speech tagging; Dutch; transformers;

AB Legal texts are often difficult to interpret, and people who interpret them need to make choices about the interpretation. To improve transparency, the interpretation of a legal text can be made explicit by formalising it. However, creating formalised representations of legal texts manually is quite labour-intensive. In this paper, we describe a method to extract structured representations in the Flint language (van Doesburg and van Engers, 2019) from natural language. Automated extraction of knowledge representation not only makes the interpretation and modelling efforts more efficient, it also contributes to reducing inter-coder dependencies. The Flint language offers a formal model that enables the interpretation of legal text by describing the norms in these texts as acts, facts and duties. To extract the components of a Flint representation, we use a rule-based method and a transformer-based method. In the transformer-based method we fine-tune the last layer with annotated legal texts. The results show that the transformed-based method (80% accuracy) outperforms the rule-based method (42% accuracy) on the Dutch Aliens Act. This indicates that the transformer-based method is a promising approach of automatically extracting Flint frames.

With a focus on scaling up participatory approaches from local to national level, the approach extends well established and open source tools and technologies, to build mobile monitoring and analysis tools that increase transparency of law-making and implementation to citizens. This is achieved by combining open data and open services with user and citizen generated content, in order to address citizen's needs in the context of open government. Data and feeds from trusted sources are interconnected with new and re-purposed data feeds generated by users via the social web to form a meaningful, searchable, customizable, re-usable and open data-focused personalised mobile public service approach. The framework exploits the social aspects of open data, as well as the training of users, citizens and public servants to be able to understand and demand useful public open data, as well as facilitate the opening of more data.

AB A conversational agent, also known as chatbot, is a machine conversational system which interacts with human users via natural language. Traditionally, chatbot technology is built under certain set of "manually" elaborated conversational rules. However, given the availability of large and real examples of humans' interactions in the web, automatically generating these rules is becoming a more feasible option. In this paper we describe an approach for building and training a conversational agent, which holds a teenager personality and it is able to dialogue in Mexican Spanish. By means of this chatter bot we aim at assisting law enforcement officers in the prevention of cyber-pedophilia. Our performed experiments demonstrate that our developed chatbot is able to elaborate comparable lexical and syntactical constructions to those a teenager would produce. As an additional contribution, we compile and release a large dialogue corpus containing real examples of conversations among teenagers.

AB A growing body of scholarly work underscores that the relationship between women's political representation and quality of government is stronger in democracies than in authoritarian regimes. The relationship, however, is less clear in regimes that are neither fully-fledged democratic nor authoritarian. I investigate the gender gap in representatives' efforts to push for improvements in the quality of government in the local councils of Albania following the implementation of gender quotas in 2015. Using the transcripts of council meetings, I identify the kind of practices that councilors challenge when holding local government officials to account, and I compare women with men. The study shows that councilors contest practices that concern law enforcement, impartiality, and transparency. Women, compared to men, are more likely to contest practices that concern transparency. The greatest gender gap is observed in councils where the implementation of gender quotas has disrupted male dominance, numerically speaking, the most.

AB Objective Analyze responses to a national request for information (RFI) to uncover gaps in policy, practice, and understanding of veteran suicide to inform federal research strategy. Data source An RFI with 21 open-ended questions generated from Presidential Executive Order #1386, administered nationally from July 3 to August 5, 2019. Study design Semi-structured, open-ended responses analyzed using a collaborative qualitative and text-mining data process. Data extraction methods We aligned traditional qualitative methods with natural language processing (NLP) text-mining techniques to analyze 9040 open-ended question responses from 722 respondents to provide results within 3 months. Narrative inquiry and the medical explanatory model guided the data extraction and analytic process. Results Five major themes were identified: risk factors, risk assessment, prevention and intervention, barriers to care, and data/research. Individuals and organizations mentioned different concepts within the same themes. In responses about risk factors, individuals frequently mentioned generic terms like "illness" while organizations mentioned specific terms like "traumatic brain injury." Organizations and individuals described unique barriers to care and emphasized ways to integrate data and research to improve points of care. Organizations often identified lack of funding as barriers while individuals often identified key moments for prevention such as military transitions and ensuring care providers have military cultural understanding. Conclusions This study provides an example of a rapid, adaptive analysis of a large body of qualitative, public response data about veteran suicide to support a federal strategy for an important public health topic. Combining qualitative and text-mining methods allowed a representation of voices and perspectives including the lived experiences of individuals who described stories of military transition, treatments that worked or did not, and the perspective of organizations treating veterans for suicide. The results supported the development of a national strategy to reduce suicide risks for veterans as well as civilians.

AB A privacy policy is a statement informing users how their information will be collected, used, and disclosed. Failing to provide a correct privacy policy may result in a fine. However, writing privacy policy is tedious and error-prone, because the author may not understand the source code well as it could have been written by others (e.g., outsourcing), or the author does not know the internal working of third-party libraries used. In this paper, we propose and develop a novel system named AutoPPG to automatically construct correct and readable descriptions to facilitate the generation of privacy policy for Android applications (i.e., apps). Given an app, AutoPPG first conducts static code analysis to characterize its behaviors related to users' personal information, and then applies natural language processing techniques to generating correct and accessible sentences for describing these behaviors. The experimental results using real apps and crowdsourcing indicate that: 1) AutoPPG creates correct and easy-to-understand descriptions for privacy policies; 2) the privacy policies constructed by AutoPPG usually reveal more operations related to users' personal information than existing privacy policies; and 3) most developers, who reply us, would like to use AutoPPG to facilitate them.

AB This paper describes the automated classification of legal norms in German statutes with regard to their semantic type. We propose a semantic type taxonomy for norms in the German civil law domain consisting of nine different types focusing on functional aspects, such as Duties, Prohibitions, Permissions, etc. We performed four iterations in classifying legal norms with a rule-based approach using a manually labeled dataset, i.e., tenancy law, of the German Civil Code (n = 601). During this experiment the F-1 score continuously improved from 0.52 to 0.78. In contrast, a machine learning based approach for the classification was implemented. A performance of F-1 = 0.83 was reached. Traditionally, machine learning classifiers lack of transparency with regard to their decisions. We extended our approach using so-called local linear approximations, which is a novel technique to analyze and inspect a trained classifier's behavior. We can show that there are significant similarities of manually crafted knowledge, i.e., rules and pattern definitions, and the trained decision structures of machine learning approaches.

AB Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.

AB Modern means of communication, economic crises, and political decisions play imperative roles in reshaping political and administrative systems throughout the world. Twitter, a micro-blogging website, has gained paramount importance in terms of public opinion-sharing. Manual intelligence of law enforcement agencies (i.e., in changing situations) cannot cope in real time. Thus, to address this problem, we built an alert system for government authorities in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The alert system gathers real-time data from Twitter in English and Roman Urdu about forthcoming gatherings (protests, demonstrations, assemblies, rallies, sit-ins, marches, etc.). To determine public sentiment regarding upcoming anti-government gatherings (protests, demonstrations, assemblies, rallies, sit-ins, marches, etc.), the alert system determines the polarity of tweets. Using keywords, the system provides information for future gatherings by extracting the entities like date, time, and location from Twitter data obtained in real time. Our system was trained and tested with different machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), multinomial naive Bayes (MNB), and Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), along with two vectorization techniques, i.e., term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) and count vectorization. Moreover, this paper compares the accuracy results of sentiment analysis (SA) of Twitter data by applying supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. In our research experiment, we used two data sets, i.e., a small data set of 1000 tweets and a large data set of 4000 tweets. Results showed that RF along with count vectorization performed best for the small data set with an accuracy of 82%; with the large data set, MNB along with count vectorization outperformed all other classifiers with an accuracy of 75%. Additionally, language models, e.g., bigram and trigram, were used to generate the word clouds of positive and negative words to visualize the most frequently used words.

We varied systematically not only the sentences, but also the visual materials, in order to study their effect on the verification process. Next, we used the same visual scenarios with analogous non-verbal probes that featured arithmetical inequality symbols (<, >). This manipulation enabled us to measure not only Polarity effects, but also, to compare the effect of different probe types (linguistic, non-linguistic) on processing.

AB The documentation that describes the regulations within a Society, is oriented towards specific areas. This fact does not prevent maintaining concordance in the temporality and transversality of the documents. This work defines the concept of "opposition relations " in legal texts. We identify entities and evaluate the polarity of each paragraph with sentiment analysis techniques. If an entity appears in different paragraphs (articles of law) with opposite polarities, we evaluate the entity's contexts. We look for antonyms between the words that give polarity to the opposite paragraphs. If there is an antonymic relation in words associated with the entity, we have an opposition relation. The described methodology analyzes the relationship of entities in Mexican Environmental Laws, and the study is oriented towards coherence in the legislation for sustainable development. This process was implemented by computational processing, which required the transformation of current Mexican laws, unifying its structure. Eight environmental laws were analyzed, 1920 entities were identified that appear more than once; 44 of them were identified with opposite polarities, due to their context, a detailed analysis of two cases with potential opposite relationships is exemplified.

AB News articles capture a variety of topics about our society. They reflect not only the socioeconomic activities that happened in our physical world, but also some of the cultures, human interests, and public concerns that exist only in the perceptions of people. Cities are frequently mentioned in news articles, and two or more cities may co-occur in the same article. Such co-occurrence often suggests certain relatedness between the mentioned cities, and the relatedness may be under different topics depending on the contents of the news articles. We consider the relatedness under different topics as semantic relatedness. By reading news articles, one can grasp the general semantic relatedness between cities; yet, given hundreds of thousands of news articles, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to manually read them. This paper proposes a computational framework which can read' a large number of news articles and extract the semantic relatedness between cities. This framework is based on a natural language processing model and employs a machine learning process to identify the main topics of news articles. We describe the overall structure of this framework and its individual modules, and then apply it to an experimental dataset with more than 500,000 news articles covering the top 100 US cities spanning a 10-year period. We perform exploratory visualizations of the extracted semantic relatedness under different topics and over multiple years. We also analyze the impact of geographic distance on semantic relatedness and find varied distance decay effects. The proposed framework can be used to support large-scale content analysis in city network research.

AB In a workshop organized in December 2017 in Leiden, the Netherlands, a group of lawyers, computer scientists, artists, activists and social and cultural scientists collectively read a computer science paper about 'improving fairness'. This session was perceived by many participants as eye-opening on how different epistemologies shape approaches to the problem, method and solutions, thus enabling further cross-disciplinary discussions during the rest of the workshop. For many participants it was both refreshing and challenging, in equal measure, to understand how another discipline approached the problem of fairness. Now, as a follow-up we propose a translation tutorial that will engage participants at the FAT* conference in a similar exercise. We will invite participants to work in small groups reading excerpts of academic papers from different disciplinary perspectives on the same theme. We argue that most of us do not read outside our disciplines and thus are not familiar with how the same issues might be framed and addressed by our peers. Thus the purpose will be to have participants reflect on the different genealogies of knowledge in research, and how they erect walls, or generate opportunities for more productive inter-disciplinary work. We argue that addressing, through technical measures or otherwise, matters of ethics, bias and discrimination in AI/ML technologies in society is complicated by the different constructions of knowledge about what ethics (or bias or discrimination) means to different groups of practitioners. In the current academic structure, there are scarce resources to test, build on-or even discard-methods to talk across disciplinary lines. This tutorial is thus proposed to see if this particular method might work.

DE data management plan; data protection; anonymisation; personal data
AB The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 27 April 2016 will apply from 25 May 2018. It will reinforce certain principles related to the processing of personal data, which will also affect many projects in the field of Natural Language Processing. Perhaps most importantly, the GDPR will introduce the principle of accountability, according to which the data processor shall be able to demonstrate compliance with the new rules, and that he applies `privacy by design and by default'. In our opinion, a well-drafted Data Management Plan (DMP) is of key importance for GDPR compliance; indeed, the trend towards the adoption of a DMP, particularly in EU-funded research projects, has been more vivid since 2017, after the extension of the Horizon 2020 Open Data Pilot. Since 2015, ELRA also proposes its own template for the Data Management Plan, which is being updated to take the new law into account. In this paper, we present the new legal framework introduced by the GDPR and propose how the new rules can be integrated in the DMP in order to increase transparency of processing, facilitate demonstration of GDPR compliance and spread good practices within the community.

We focus on questions about transportation law - the law with arguably the largest number of violations and thus is the most asked about. Given a legal question in natural language, our goal is to extract important information such as Type of Vehicle, Action of Vehicle, Location, and Question Type. We model the question analysis task as a sequence labeling problem and present a CRF-based method to deal with it. Experimental results on a corpus consisting of 1678 Vietnamese questions show that our method can extract 16 types of information with high precision and recall.

AB We compared entropy for texts written in natural languages (English, Spanish) and artificial languages (computer software) based on a simple expression for the entropy as a function of message length and specific word diversity. Code text written in artificial languages showed higher entropy than text of similar length expressed in natural languages. Spanish texts exhibit more symbolic diversity than English ones. Results showed that algorithms based on complexity measures differentiate artificial from natural languages, and that text analysis based on complexity measures allows the unveiling of important aspects of their nature. We propose specific expressions to examine entropy related aspects of tests and estimate the values of entropy, emergence, self-organization, and complexity based on specific diversity and message length.

AB Despite extensive empirical evidence of the environmental benefits of green buildings and the increasing urgency to reduce carbon emissions in cities, there has been limited widespread adoption of energy retrofit investments in existing buildings. In this paper, we empirically model financial returns to energy retrofit investments for more than 3600 multifamily and commercial buildings in New York City, using a comprehensive database of energy audits and renovation work extracted from city records using a natural language processing algorithm. Based on auditor cost and savings estimates, the median internal rate of return for adopted energy conservation measures is 21% for multifamily buildings and 25% for office properties. Logistic regression modeling demonstrates adoption rates are higher for office buildings than multifamily, and in both cases adopter buildings tend to be larger, higher value, and less energy efficient prior to retrofit implementation. The economically significant magnitudes of returns to adopted energy conservation measures raise important questions about why many property owners choose not to adopt. As such, we discuss incentive and regulatory mechanisms that can overcome financial and informational barriers to the adoption of energy efficiency measures.

   General Data Protection Regulation
AB The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has compelled businesses and other organizations to update their privacy policies to state specific information about their data practices. Simultaneously, researchers in natural language processing (NLP) have developed corpora and annotation schemes for extracting salient information from privacy policies, often independently of specific laws. To connect existing NLP research on privacy policies with the GDPR, we introduce a mapping from GDPR provisions to the OPP-115 annotation scheme, which serves as the basis for a growing number of projects to automatically classify privacy policy text. We show that assumptions made in the annotation scheme about the essential topics for a privacy policy reflect many of the same topics that the GDPR requires in these documents. This suggests that OPP-115 continues to be representative of the anatomy of a legally compliant privacy policy, and that the legal assumptions behind it represent the elements of data processing that ought to be disclosed within a policy for transparency. The correspondences we show between OPP-115 and the GDPR suggest the feasibility of bridging existing computational and legal research on privacy policies, benefiting both areas.

AB Recent research shows that algorithms learn societal biases from large text corpora. We examine the marketplace-relevant consequences of such bias for consumers. Based on billions of documents from online text corpora, we first demonstrate that from gender biases embedded in language, algorithms learn to associate women with more negative consumer psychographic attributes than men (e.g., associating women more closely with impulsive vs. planned investors). Second, in a series of field experiments, we show that such learning results in the delivery of gender-biased digital advertisements and product recommendations. Specifically, across multiple platforms, products, and attributes, we find that digital advertisements containing negative psychographic attributes (e.g., impulsive) are more likely to be delivered to women compared to men, and that search engine product recommendations are similarly biased, which influences consumer's consideration sets and choice. Finally, we empirically examine consumer's role in co-producing algorithmic gender bias in the marketplace and observe that consumers reinforce these biases by accepting gender stereotypes (i.e., clicking on biased ads). We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical implications.

Considering this fact provided by law, in 2017, the High School National Exam (ENEM), an exam organized by governmental education sector for people to ingress in undergraduate programs, first offered the video-exam in Libras for D/HH candidates to access contents in Libras. The video-exam can be considered as an Assistive Technology product, since it may enable D/HH students' autonomy by displaying contents in their natural language. A framework for adoption of an Assistive Technology is under validation through a case study co-designed with stakeholders, in which this investigation is part of the process. In this paper we show requirements and main questions categorized in six levels of the Semiotic Ladder artifact and, from it, we define the group who are the most important stakeholders that have to participate in futures semio-participatory workshops.

AB In recent years, the problem of data leakage often appears in our lives. As of today, a number of enterprises have been fined heavily for the leakage of user data, including Facebook, Uber and Equifax. This paper makes deep research on the privacy protection of the text. We proposed a three-layer privacy protection mechanism for carrying out privacy-preserving text perturbation. This approach allows different levels of privacy protection for different parts of the text, thereby increasing the level of privacy protection without reducing utility. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed method not only provides fine-grained control over the level of privacy in that data but also improves performance.

AB Job seekers find themselves increasingly duped and misled by fraudulent job advertisements, posing a threat to their privacy, security and well-being. There is a clear need for solutions that can protect innocent job seekers. Existing approaches to detecting fraudulent jobs do not scale well, function like a black-box, and lack interpretability, which is essential to guide applicants' decision-making. Moreover, commonly used lexical features may be insufficient as the representation does not capture contextual semantics of the underlying document. Hence, this paper explores to what extent different categorizations of fraudulent jobs can be classified. In addition, this paper seeks to find what type of features are most relevant in classifying the type of fraudulent job. In this paper, we develop and validate a machine learning system for identifying identity theft, corporate identity theft and multi-level marketing amongst fraudulent job advertisements. We utilized four classes of features: empirical rule set-based features, bag-of-word models, most recent state-of-the-art word embeddings and transformer models for various machine learning classifiers. The machine learning models were validated by evaluating them on a publicly available job description dataset. Our results indicate that the word embeddings and transformer-based features consistently outperformed the handcrafted rule-set based features class. Ultimately, a Gradient Boosting classifier with a combination of empirical rule-set based features, parts-of-speech tags and bag-of-words vectors achieved the best performance with an F1-score of 0.88.

This paper addresses this shortcoming using a novel approach that applies natural language processing techniques to countries' annual statements in the UN General Debate. Every year UN member states deliver statements during the General Debate on their governments' perspective on major issues in world politics. These speeches provide invaluable information on state preferences on a wide range of issues, including international development, but have largely been overlooked in the study of global politics. This paper identifies the main international development topics that states raise in these speeches between 1970 and 2016, and examine the country-specific drivers of international development rhetoric.

This study uses Python language to analyze the big data of the Chinese provincial government Weibo. First, this study uses a web crawler approach to collect and statistically describe over 360,000 data from 31 provincial government microblogs in China, covering the period from January 2018 to April 2022. Second, a word separation engine is constructed and these text data are analyzed using word cloud word frequencies as well as semantic relationships. Finally, the text data were analyzed for sentiment using natural language processing methods, and the text topics were studied using LDA algorithm. The results of this study show that, first, the number and scale of posts on the Chinese government Weibo have grown rapidly. Second, government Weibo has certain social attributes, and the epidemics, people's livelihood, and services have become the focus of government Weibo. Third, the contents of government Weibo account for more than 30% of negative sentiments. The classified topics show that the epidemics and epidemic prevention and control overshadowed the other topics, which inhibits the diversification of government Weibo.

AB Neural network-based approaches have become the driven forces for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Conventionally, there are two mainstream neural architectures for NLP tasks: the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the convolution neural network (ConvNet). RNNs are good at modeling long-term dependencies over input texts, but preclude parallel computation. ConvNets do not have memory capability and it has to model sequential data as un-ordered features. Therefore, ConvNets fail to learn sequential dependencies over the input texts, but it is able to carry out high-efficient parallel computation. As each neural architecture, such as RNN and ConvNets, has its own pro and con, integration of different architectures is assumed to be able to enrich the semantic representation of texts, thus enhance the performance of NLP tasks. However, few investigation explores the reconciliation of these seemingly incompatible architectures. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid architecture based on a novel hierarchical multi-granularity attention mechanism, named Multi-granularity Attention-based Hybrid Neural Network (MahNN). The attention mechanism is to assign different weights to different parts of the input sequence to increase the computation efficiency and performance of neural models. In MahNN, two types of attentions are introduced: the syntactical attention and the semantical attention. The syntactical attention computes the importance of the syntactic elements (such as words or sentence) at the lower symbolic level and the semantical attention is used to compute the importance of the embedded space dimension corresponding to the upper latent semantics. We adopt the text classification as an exemplifying way to illustrate the ability of MahNN to understand texts. The experimental results on a variety of datasets demonstrate that MahNN outperforms most of the state-of-the-arts for text classification.

However, the generation of data and demand for computing are increasing exponentially with time. Thus, there is a critical need to invent new computing primitives, both hardware and algorithms, to keep up with the computing demands. The brain is a natural computer that outperforms our best computers in solving certain problems, such as instantly identifying faces or understanding natural language. This realization has led to a flurry of research into neuromorphic or brain-inspired computing that has shown promise for enhanced computing capabilities. This review points to the important primitives of a brain-inspired computer that could drive another decade-long wave of computer engineering.

ID LAND-USE; ZIPFS LAW; CITIES; ZONES; AREAS
AB Delineating urban functional use plays a key role in understanding urban dynamics, evaluating planning strategies and supporting policymaking. In recent years, Points of Interest (POI) data, with precise geolocation and detailed attributes, have become the primary data source for exploring urban functional use from a bottom-up perspective, using local, highly disaggregated, big datasets. Previous studies using POI data have given insufficient consideration to the relationship among POI classes in the spatial context, and have failed to provide a straightforward means by which to classify urban functional areas. This study proposes an approach for delineating urban functional use at the scale of the Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) in Greater London by integrating the Doc2Vec model, a neural network embedding method commonly used in natural language processing for vectoring words and documents from their context. In this study, the neural network vectorises both POI classes ('Word') and urban areas ('Document') based on their functional context by learning features from the spatial distribution of POIs in the city. Specifically, we first construct POI sequences based on the distribution of POI classes, and add their LSOA IDs as 'document' tags. By utilising these constructed POI-LSOA sequences, the Doc2Vec model trains the vectors of 574 POI classes (word vectors) and 4836 LSOAs (document vectors). The vectors of POI classes are then used in calculating the functional similarity scores based on their cosine distance, with the vectors of LSOAs grouped into clusters (i.e., functional areas) via the k-means clustering algorithm. We also identify latent functions in each cluster of LSOAs by performing topic modelling and enrichment factor. Compared with TF-IDF, LDA and Word2Vec models, the Doc2Vec model obtains the highest accuracy when classifying functional areas. This study proposes a straightforward approach in which the model directly trains vectors for urban areas, subsequently using them to classify urban functional areas. By employing the enhanced neural network model with low-cost and ubiquitous POI datasets, this study provides a potential tool with which to monitor urban dynamics in a timely and adaptive manner, thereby providing enhanced, datadriven support to urban planning, development and management.

AB This paper investigates the effect of a new bus route on noise complaints of residents and the influence of noise on housing price. To overcome the challenge of mapping noise data with subjective emotion, we use a novel data source-text-based noise complaint records from residents in a town in Singapore-and apply natural language processing tools to conduct sentiment analysis. To address the endogeneity concern regarding the bus route, we use a hypothetical least cost path as an instrument for the existing bus route. We find that living closer to the bus route for every 100 m increases noise complaints by around 10 percentage points, and the effect is more severe on medium floor levels (5th-8th floors) and near bus stops (within 100 m). We further link noise with housing price and discover a price reduction of 3% with a 1-scale-point increase in noise complaints. This implies that bus noise offsets 17.8% of the benefit from convenience, which sheds light on the importance of noise insulation in transit-oriented developments.

In this approach, students study transcripts of US Supreme Court oral argument and create a graphical representation of argument flow as tests offered by attorneys being challenged by hypotheticals posed by Justices. The proposed system, which is based on the collaborative modeling framework Cool Modes, is capable of detecting three types of weaknesses in arguments; when it does, it presents the student with a self explanation prompt. This kind of feedback seems more appropriate than the "strong connective feedback" typically offered by model-tracing or constraint-based tutors. Structural and context weaknesses in arguments are handled by graph grammars, and the critical problem of detecting and dealing with content weaknesses in student contributions is addressed through a collaborative filtering approach, thereby avoiding the critical problem of natural language processing in legal argumentation. An early version of the system was pilot tested with two students.

Extended knowledge, wide-ranging information, substantial expertise, and continuous improvement are required to attain accurate cost estimation. Cost estimation at the preliminary phase of the project is always a challenge as only limited information is available. Hence, rational selection of input variables for preliminary cost estimation could be imperative. A systematic input variable selection approach for preliminary estimating using an integrated methodology of factor analysis and fuzzy AHP is presented in this paper. First, the factor analysis is used to classify and reduce the input variables and their variable coefficients are determined. Second, fuzzy AHP based on the geometric mean method is employed to determine the weights of input variables in a fuzzy environment where the subjectivity and vagueness are handled with natural language expressions parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, the input variables are suggested to be selected starting with those having high coefficient and high importance weight. A set of three variables, one from each group, can be added to the estimating model at a time so that the problem of collinearity can vanish and good accuracy of the estimate can be ensured. The proposed approach enables cost estimators to better understand the complete input variable selection process at the early stage of project development and provide a more accurate, rational, and systematic decision support tool.

TI GUIDING ASSERTIONS AND QUESTIONS IN DISCOURSE MANDARIN DIQUE AND ZHENDE
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE & LINGUISTIC THEORY
DE Speech acts; Discourse structure; Common Ground; Table stack;
   Presupposition; Mandarin
AB This paper explores how discourse markers contribute to the update of discourse through a detailed study of Mandarin dique 'indeed' and zhende 'really'. On the basis of empirical data and a naturalness rating experiment, we show that dique and zhende make similar yet different contributions to discourse updates. Dique presupposes that its prejacent issue is old, while zhende presupposes that its prejacent issue is old and that some discourse participant has failed to resolve this issue. Furthermore, dique and zhende can embed both assertions and questions. This supports Farkas and Bruce's (2010) Table stack model, which provides a uniform treatment for assertions and questions.

TI GENERAL PRACTICE AND THE COMMUNITY: RESEARCH ON HEALTH SERVICE, QUALITY
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
AB Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64 years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations. Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150 minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant. Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5 points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.

AB Abstract This article aims to present the Syntactic Parser for Brazilian Portuguese - Parsero -, developed from the Generative Grammar (CHOMSKY, 2015) improved by the X-Barra Theory (CHOMSKY, 2014). Therefore, the rules developed by Othero (2009) especially for Brazilian Portuguese were used and adapted by our project to meet the needs of our Parser. The research used as lexical collection, to populate a Structured Query Language (SQL) Database, the resource Dictionary of Simple Inflected Words for Brazilian Portuguese (DELAF_PB), which was made available available by the Unitex-PB Project, developed by Núcleo Interinstitucional de Linguística Computacional (NILC) and by Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação (ICMC). This resource, in turn, was built based on the French formalism - Dictionnarie Electronique du LADL (DELA) (MUNIZ, 2004). As a result of our project, we have made available to researchers interested in the topic the SQL Database with 1,193,295 classified lexical units, the address with the open source of Parsero and a link to run the application. Throughout the development of the Natural Language Processor (NLP), we had to put into practice interdisciplinary studies from language sciences and computer sciences, a necessary practice for the development of intelligent programs that can interact with writers or Brazilian Portuguese speakers.

TI USE OF COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS AS SUPPORT TO THE CROSS-MAPPING METHOD BETWEEN CLINICAL TERMINOLOGIES
SO TEXTO & CONTEXTO - ENFERMAGEM	
DE Terminology; Nursing; Informatics; Controlled vocabulary; Methods	
AB ABSTRACT Objective: to reflect on the use of computational tools in the cross-mapping method between clinical terminologies. Method: reflection study. Results: the cross-mapping method consists of obtaining a list of terms through extraction and normalization; the connection between the terms of the list and those of the reference base, by means of predefined rules; and grouping of the terms into categories: exact or partial combination or, in more detail, similar term, more comprehensive term, more restricted term and non-agreeing term. Performed manually in many studies, it can be automated with the use of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Obtaining the terms list can occur automatically by natural language processing algorithms, being that the use of rules to identify information in texts allows the expert's knowledge to be coupled to the algorithm, and it can be performed by techniques based on Machine Learning. When it comes to mapping terms using the 7-Axis model of the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP®), the process can also be automated through natural language processing algorithms such as POS-tagger and the syntactic parser. Conclusion: the cross-mapping method can be intensified by the use of natural language processing algorithms. However, even in cases of automatic mapping, the validation of the results by specialists should not be discarded.

DE Corpus linguistics; Natural language processing; Scientific article; Text genre; Corpora annotation	
AB Abstract The present article was developed in the field of Natural Language Processing and Language Studies based on a corpus compiled by computational tools. This study is based on the assumption that it is helpful to trace a close relationship between corpus generation/annotation and the assessment of the constitutive elements of the text genre source. It aims to demonstrate, through specific studies of structured data from the text genre ‘scientific article’, alternatives to automatic text processing techniques. In order to reach the intended goal, the authors created a computational model for the compilation of a linguistic, specialized Corpus, representative of the genre Scientific Article CorpACE. The object of study includes the constitutive elements of scientific articles, marked in XML, extracted and collected from the SciELO-Scientific Electronic Library Online database. The final product was a database obtained with information extracted and structured in XML format, which designates and identifies the markups of the genre being analyzed and is available for many tools and applications. The results demonstrate how the representation of constitutive elements of the genre can condense available information with hierarchical and dynamic processes built during the compilation. At the end of the study, it is believed that more research will be required for bringing Language Science and Computer Science closer with emphasis on NLP in the attempt to represent and manipulate linguistic knowledge in its many levels - morphological, syntactic, semantic and discursive - in order to improve implementation and manipulation of automatic text processing.

DE natural language processing; language tests; narratives; adults; educational status; age groups	
AB Discourse production is an important aspect in the evaluation of brain-injured individuals. We believe that studies comparing the performance of brain-injured subjects with that of healthy controls must use groups with compatible education. A pioneering application of machine learning methods using Brazilian Portuguese for clinical purposes is described, highlighting education as an important variable in the Brazilian scenario.OBJECTIVE: The aims were to describe how to: (i) develop machine learning classifiers using features generated by natural language processing tools to distinguish descriptions produced by healthy individuals into classes based on their years of education; and (ii) automatically identify the features that best distinguish the groups.METHODS: The approach proposed here extracts linguistic features automatically from the written descriptions with the aid of two Natural Language Processing tools: Coh-Metrix-Port and AIC. It also includes nine task-specific features (three new ones, two extracted manually, besides description time; type of scene described - simple or complex; presentation order - which type of picture was described first; and age). In this study, the descriptions by 144 of the subjects studied in Toledo18 were used, which included 200 healthy Brazilians of both genders.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is the most recommended approach for the binary classification of our data, classifying three of the four initial classes. CfsSubsetEval (CFS) is a strong candidate to replace manual feature selection methods.

DE computational intelligence; computational linguistics; evolutionary computing; heuristic algorithms; natural language processing; parts of speech tagging; search methods	
AB Abstract Part-of-Speech Tagging (POST) is a complex task in the preprocessing of Natural Language Processing applications. Tagging has been tackled from statistical information and rule-based approaches, making use of a range of methods. Most recently, metaheuristic algorithms have gained attention while being used in a wide variety of knowledge areas, with good results. As a result, they were deployed in this research in a POST problem to assign the best sequence of tags (roles) for the words of a sentence based on information statistics. This process was carried out in two cycles, each of them comprised four phases, allowing the adaptation to the tagging problem in metaheuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Jaya, Random-Restart Hill Climbing, and a memetic algorithm based on Global-Best Harmony Search as a global optimizer, and on Hill Climbing as a local optimizer. In the consolidation of each algorithm, preliminary experiments were carried out (using cross-validation) to adjust the parameters of each algorithm and, thus, evaluate them on the datasets of the complete tagged corpus: IULA (Spanish), Brown (English) and Nasa Yuwe (Nasa). The results obtained by the proposed taggers were compared, and the Friedman and Wilcoxon statistical tests were applied, confirming that the proposed memetic, GBHS Tagger, obtained better results in precision. The proposed taggers make an important contribution to POST for traditional languages (English and Spanish), non-traditional languages (Nasa Yuwe), and their application areas.

AB ABSTRACT Recent achievements have turned Computational linguistics into a dynamic research area, and an important field of application development that is being explored by leading technology companies. Despite the advances, there is still much room for improvement to allow humans to interact with computational devices, through natural language, in the same way that humans interact with native speakers of the same language. How to make computers understand or create new metaphors, metonymies or other figures of language? Is it possible to develop natural language systems capable of producing lyrics or poetry on the same level as humans? Can we produce systems capable of assigning new meanings to syntactic elements that are immediately perceived as coherent by humans? In this paper, we account for the evolution of computational linguistics, drawing a parallel with the evolution of linguistic theories and speculating about its research opportunities and foreseeable limitations.

This aims to support information activities that go beyond legal interpretation itself, aligned with Open Government Data. The article describes a series of datasets containing the results of transformations of the Brazilian legal norms base, which include the articulated texts of the norms in LexML, CoNLL-U, syntactic representations of sentences obtained with the Google Natural Language Processing API, among others.

AB ABSTRACT Objective: to describe the development of a virtual assistant as a potential tool for health co-production in coping with COVID-19. Method: this is an applied technological production research study developed in March and April 2020 in five stages: 1) literature review, 2) content definition, 3) elaboration of the dialog, 4) test of the prototype, and 5) integration with the social media page. Results: the literature review gathered diverse scientific evidence about the disease based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health publications and by consulting scientific articles. The content was built from the questions most asked by the population, in March 2020, evidenced by Google Trends, in which the following topics emerged: concept of the disease, prevention means, transmission of the disease, main symptoms, treatment modalities, and doubts. Elaboration of the dialog was based on Natural Language Processing, intentions, entities and dialog structure. The prototype was tested in a laboratory with a small number of user computers on a local network to verify the functionality of the set of apps, technical and visual errors in the dialog, and whether the answers provided were in accordance with the user's question, answering the questions correctly and integrated into Facebook. Conclusion: the virtual assistant proved to be a health education tool with potential to combat “Fake News”. It also represents a patient-centered form of health communication that favors the strengthening of the bond and interaction between health professionals and patients, promoting co-production in health.

AB In reservation-based industries, an accurate booking cancellation forecast is of foremost importance to estimate demand. By combining data science tools and capabilities with human judgement and interpretation, this paper aims to demonstrate how the semiautomatic analysis of the literature can contribute to synthesizing research findings and identify research topics about booking cancellation forecasting. Furthermore, this works aims, by detailing the full experimental procedure of the analysis, to encourage other authors to conduct automated literature analysis as a means to understand current research in their working fields. The data used was obtained through a keyword search in Scopus and Web of Science databases. The methodology presented not only diminishes human bias, but also enhances the fact that data visualisation and text mining techniques facilitate abstraction, expedite analysis, and contribute to the improvement of reviews. Results show that despite the importance of bookings’ cancellation forecast in terms of understanding net demand, improving cancellation, and overbooking policies, further research on the subject is still needed.

AB Abstract However, searching for software components on GitHub is currently inefficient, as searches are based on text strings. This paper introduces OntoGitHubSearch as a search model that allows the retrieval and classification of software architectures stored on GitHub. This proposed model retrieves all repositories that match the searched architectural concepts; to provide the search with semantics and context, it implements the domain-specific ontology Architecture Ontology Version 2.0, as well as a natural language processing module to analyze the text in the repository. The repositories are automatically identified and classified according to the text and concepts found in their descriptions. To evaluate the proposed model, we developed a web application called WebOntoGitHubSearch, which allows interaction with users during the search process. The evaluation of the model was carried out with the participation of software developers and architects from several colombian businesses. Information retrieval metrics such as Precision at k. The results obtained during the evaluation process are promising and allow verifying the effectiveness of the proposed model.

DE Medical education; Medical students; Physician’s role; Medical ethics	
AB ABSTRACT Background Although overall cultural differences exist between individuals from the X and Y generations, to our knowledge few previous studies have contrasted their expectations regarding what good doctors are, and their perceptions on the training processes they undergo. Aims To conduct a study exploring perceptions on what good doctors are and their perceptions about training among a sample of Brazilian medical students at the University of Sao Paulo Medical School, comparing groups from 2000 and 2014. We aimed to provide information that can be used to guide curriculum development in medical schools. Methods We conducted a mixed methods study of a series of open questions asked to medical students from the University of São Paulo, Brazil, in 2000 and 2014. This qualitative analysis focused on uncovering emerging themes related to students’ perceptions regarding what good doctors are and how they see their training process. A subsequent quantitative analysis through Natural Language Processing was undertaken. Results Gender distribution was balanced between the 2000 and 2014 groups, with most students being in the early 20s. Our main emerging concepts involved four themes: Skills and qualities of a good doctor, positive and negative aspects of the curriculum, as well as expectations related to students’ future career. From a qualitative perspective, the 2014 group focused their criticisms on the School of Medicine itself and the study overload, while the 2000 group focused its criticism on the faculty and competition. Therefore, the 2014 group experienced more criticism and less idealization in relation to the School and the medical training process. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2000 and 2014 groups, as well as across genders. Discussion Students in this sample have demonstrated little change over time in relation to their characterization of what good doctors are and how they should be trained. Their preferences for a practical, patient-centered education should guide future curriculum development in medical schools.

AB Abstract Machine translation (MT) is used to obtain annotated corpus of English corpus which can be applicable to different natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Considering that there are more resources or data sets for training NLP models in English language, this paper explores the application of MT to automate NLP tasks in Spanish. Thus, the article describes a dataset for the extraction of generic relations (reACE) and the construction of a semantic extraction model of relations in Spanish (ER), based on the set of samples translated from English to Spanish. The results show that for the MT task it is necessary to implement a corpus pre-editing process in English to avoid translation and post-editing errors and maintain the original corpus annotations. The ER models in Spanish achieve measures of accuracy, completeness, and F-value comparable to those obtained by the model in the English language, which suggests that machine translation is a useful tool to perform NLP tasks in the Spanish language.

AB During the post-marketing period, when medicines are used by large population contingents and for longer periods, unexpected adverse events (AE) can occur, potentially altering the drug’s risk-benefit ratio enough to demand regulatory action. AE are health problems that can occur during treatment with a pharmaceutical product, which in the drug’s post-marketing period can require a significant increase in health care and result in unnecessary and often fatal harm to patients. Therefore, a key objective for the health system is to identify AE as soon as possible in the post-marketing period. Some countries have pharmacovigilance systems responsible for collecting voluntary reports of post-marketing AE, but studies have shown that social networks can be used to obtain more and faster reports. The current project’s main objective is to build a totally automated system using Twitter as a source to detect both new and previously known AE and conduct the statistical analysis of the resulting data. A system was thus built to collect, process, analyze, and assess tweets in search of AE, comparing them to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data and the reference standard. The results allowed detecting new and existing AE related to the drug doxycycline, showing that Twitter can be useful in pharmacovigilance when employed jointly with other data sources.

DE Semantics; Symbouletic modality; Pragmatics; Procedural meaning	
AB Abstract: The present paper aims to raise awareness of the importance of an integrated teaching of semantics and pragmatics, especially the linguistic-communicative competence in the additional language classroom. In order to support it, we have discussed symbouletic modality, a natural language phenomenon that takes place precisely at the interface of form and use. At first we discuss Kratzer's (1981, 1991, 2012) framework for natural language modality and Yanovich's (2013a, 2013b) proposal for the symbouletic modal flavor. After that, we discuss pragmatic cognitive tools for language process analysis in the form of conceptual and procedural meanings, based on Sperber and Wilson's (1995) relevance theory. Lastly, by this illustration, we reinforce our original argument, hoping to bridge further the gap sometimes found between linguistic research and additional language pedagogy.

DE Classification; Natural Language Processing; Information Retrieval; Artificial Neural Networks; Training	
AB Abstract The amount of unstructured data grows with the popularization of the Internet. Texts in natural language represent a relevant and significant set for the analysis and production of knowledge. This work proposes a quantitative analysis of the preprocessing and training stages of a text classifier, which uses as an attribute the feelings expressed by the users. Artificial Neural Network, as a classifier algorithm, and texts from Amazon, IMDB and Yelp sites were used for the experiments. The database allows the analysis of the expression of positive and negative feelings of the users in evaluations of products and services in unstructured texts. Two distinct processes of preprocessing and different training of the Artificial Neural Networks were carried out to classify the textual set. The results quantitatively confirm the importance of the preprocessing and training stages of the classifier, highlighting the importance of the vocabulary selected for the text representation and classification. The available classification techniques achieve satisfactory results. However, even by using two distinct processes of preprocessing and identifying the best training process, it was not possible to totally eliminate the learning difficulties and understanding of the model for the classifications of feelings that involved subjective characteristics of the expression of human feeling.

AB The use of different semiotic registers and the change of register are characteristics of the cognitive activity in mathematics, and the difficulties associated to these changes a source of incomprehension and learning difficulties. In the conversion process from the natural to the algebraic language, at least two types of cognitive skills are involved: to handle syntactic structures in natural language, and to mentally mobilize the mathematical concepts expressed in the text. In order to study the relevance of each skill, the associated difficulties and interrelationship, we designed a questionnaire, handed it out to a group of Engineering students, and analyzed the results by means of statistical hypothesis testing, from which we obtained conclusions applicable to teaching design. The results show differences depending on the so-called congruence of the semiotic register change, as well as on the verbal statement of syntactic complexity.

AB ABSTRACT Introduction: The use of programming languages in the context of Metric Information Studies has gained ground among the scientific community in the area as they are practical, free or have low computational cost. Objectives: To present a new, free and alternative bibliometric tool, aimed at relational citation analysis, focusing on bibliographic coupling, built on the R programming language, entitled The Coupler. Methodology: We ground the relational analysis of citation, co-citation and bibliographic coupling from a mathematical perspective and present the source code of the tool and the conditions under which it was built with its access granted for all. We use generic data and expose all its features to test the tool; and to demonstrate the use with real data, we operate bibliometric, patentometric, altmetric and natural language data. Results: The tool builds citation, coupling and co-citation matrices, in addition to calculating normalized values via Salton’s Cosine and Jaccard Index of the bibliographic coupling frequencies. Furthermore, The Coupler builds bibliographic coupling networks and identifies the coupling units responsible for each coupling pair; the latter feature, a distinct result for traditional bibliometric software. Conclusion: The paper concludes that the tool behaves as expected and satisfactorily when processing both generic data and bibliometric, patentometric, altmetric and natural language data. Among the results, especially and differentiating from other software, we highlight the identification of coupling units, and calculations of normalized coupling frequencies via Salton’s Cosine and Jaccard Index.

DE Management of production systems; Business processes; Requirements specification; Ambiguity level	
AB Abstract The aim of this controlled and randomized experimental study was to analyze the functional requirement specification. The possible impacts of process modeling notation method in the ambiguity level of natural language specification were evaluated. The notations were used as a tool to express the user's needs about buying process in e-commerce applications - typical Enterprise Information System use case. From a low-fidelity prototype, that represents the purchasing process in a virtual store, 43 undergraduate computer science students were grouped according to the notations performed: natural (Brazilian Portuguese) language control group (CG); finite state machine experimental group (FSMEG); and combined notation experimental group (CNEG) that used manual annotation of semantic roles based on finite state machine. It was used the concept that deals with ambiguity as inconsistent information that leads to multiple interpretations of functional requirement specification document. By a Test-based Reading technique, associated with the use of appropriate quality metric, a one-way analysis of variance (completely randomized design) was conducted to know if notation method, as a primary factor, affects the ambiguity level. The inter-group comparison suggests that: combined notation is the best method to minimize ambiguity levels in requirement specification; and that requirement specification expressed in finite state machine generates the higher ambiguity level among assessed notations. However, these trends are not statistically significant. Generally, it was observed that the independent variable, notation method, does not affect the ambiguity level in the process described in the functional requirement specification.

DE logic; argumentation; texts comprehension; critical thinking; teaching	
AB Abstract This paper presents the results from research about the contributions of propositional logic in the development of two fundamental competencies of critical thinking: argumentation and texts comprehension in students in 10th grade. As resources, philosophical texts were used. The study was qualitative with a descriptive scope. The results found were that leading students through the transition from formal language to natural language strengthens their inferential, creative and critical reading development skills. Likewise, in the arguments process of formalization, thestudents acquired elements to evaluate their own and other people's speeches, find their weaknesses, and initiate a process of restructuring their arguments based on the Toulminian model. Considering the latter, it was evidenced that, contrary to what Toulmin himself sometimes seems to suggest, propositional learning of logic is not an obstacle to developing competencies such as dialectic argumentation. On the contrary, well-used propositional logic can be a useful method for students to be able to structure better their reasoning and assess more accurately those of their peers based on more solid and explicit criteria.

AB Abstract: We estimate a measure of political ideology using as data a corpus of over two decades of speeches delivered by Brazilian Federal Senators across five legislatures. We employ a computational technique that analyses political speech by extracting the dictionaries that best translate the content of each ideology. Through this supervised learning method, we calculate the classification accuracy over these political texts and show that polarization is increasing across the legislatures. The method also reveals the evolving patterns of political ideologies over a period of deep change in Brazilian society. We further investigate the political dynamic across legislatures by comparing our results with current approaches to ideology in the political science literature.

Considering the demonstration that the representative signs mediation takes place in three different instances, we tried to detect if the same logic that commands Rousseau's system as a whole is also verified in his musical theories. Here we demonstrate that Rousseau's musical conceptions, expressed through a hierarchical sequence of values going from minimum to maximum insertion of representative signs, are perfectly integrated in the author's work, agreeing with the principles on which his doctrines are based.

DE Digital Narratives; Remediation; Scratch; Computational Thinking; Written Language.	
AB ABSTRACT: This study was motivated by a concern with the recurring reports of teachers and professors who work in High School and Higher Education about the deficiency of students regarding natural language written in the standard norm and the organization of solutions to problems related to employing strategies associated with computational thinking (CT). Given this challenging context, we conducted an Integrative Literature Review to analyze didactic sequences of works involving the construction of multimodal narratives in Elementary School, which simultaneously work on developing written language and CT. In addition, classroom teachers were also interviewed to listen to their experiences regarding the investigated theme. Four volunteers participated in these exploratory interviews. As a result of the Integrative Literature Review and the interviews, we proposed a didactic sequence that includes remediation as the axis around which natural language written in the standard norm is articulated with the authorship of digital narratives to strengthen the student as a writer and the conscious use of linguistic varieties and to develop computational thinking. For future research, it is important to apply the proposed didactic sequence in a classroom context for its validation and improvement.

This point has been highlighted by some researchers (e.g., Wason) as evidence of the inability of the human mind to understand the conditional sentences. In the present article, we discuss the importance of being considered the pragmatic influences in the daily conditional reasoning; because, differently of the logical reasoning, the daily reasoning does not happen in "a vacuum", but inserted in a context where the pragmatic influences occur. Initially, we introduce some precepts of the formal logic for the conditional reasoning. Next, we present the interpretation of the conditional sentences in the natural language. Some empiric evidences for the influence of pragmatic factors in the conditional reasoning will also be discussed. Finally, we consider the "theory of if" proposed by Braine and O'Brien that establishes a connection between the mental and pragmatic logic in the daily reasoning.

AB Abstract The digital personal assistants are communication artefacts that help users execute daily activities in an automatized fashion, by means of natural language either spoken or written. Amongst the first type ones are Alexa (Amazon) and Siri (Apple), whereas we can highlight Lu (Magazine Luiza) and Bia (Bradesco) as examples of the second type. They are robots portrayed as humanlike female characters, and suffer constant verbal aggression by the users. Based on theoretical discussion about the relationships between technology and gender, as well as an empirical look at cases involving the before mentioned assistants, we present recently made changes to their own discourse as a way to oppose insults, arguing that they can be considered intentional performance ruptures. We conclude that, although this is a first step against sexism, the updates are still insufficient, and gender oppression is still at place, even with non-human agents.

AB ABSTRACT This work aims to create an overview of the uses of the term folksonomy in the Literature of Information Science through the analysis of the enunciated concepts. It contributes with a step toward consolidation of the folksonomy concept taking into account definitions used by authors working with the theme and by the creator of this terminology, Thomas Vander Wal. The research’s nature is exploratory and bibliographical based on content analysis and literature review about folksonomy and collaborative representation of information. It points out that there is not a single, clear, well enunciated and rigorous definition about folksonomy. It concludes proposing the concept of Folksonomy as: the result of free labeling process (assignment of tags or keywords) performed by users through the use of terms from the natural language - dispensing the use of controlled vocabularies - in collaborative digital environments aiming to indexing shared information resources of any format (text, images, audio, video, etc.) for purposes of their representation and retrieval.

TI A CARACTERIZAÇÃO DA LÓGICA PELA FORÇA ASSERTÓRICA EM FREGE. RESPOSTA A MARCO RUFFINO
SO MANUSCRITO	
DE Frege; Essence of logic; Truth; Assertoric force	
AB According to the standard characterization of logic in Frege's writings, the word "true" indicates the essence of logic, as the word "good" indicates the essence of ethics and the word "beautiful" the essence of aesthetics. In a posthumous writing from 1915, however, Frege says that it is the assertoric force, and not the word "true", which indicates the essence of logic properly. Prima facie, this correction is in conflict with Frege's criticism of the psychologist conception of logic. For according to this criticism, logic is not the science of the laws of "being taken as true", but the science of the laws of "being true", while the assertoric force expresses being taken as true. In previous writings, I tried to resolve this conflict by a reconstruction of Frege's conception of truth that is based on his thesis that truth is expressed in natural language by the "form of the assertoric sentence". The goal of this paper is to defend this interpretation against the objections recently made by Marco Ruffino.

By showing that natural language has semiotic resources or options of meaning to reflect about itself, this paper questions the desire to have formalized higher-order metalanguages.

AB The Ancient Greeks, since the sophists' texts represented threats to legitimate reasoning anchored in the notion of truth, tried to examine the relationship among valid, informal and fallacious arguments. Aristotle distinguished mainly formal ways of abstractions from the daily practical uses, addressing the relationships between the logical forms and the interferences of content. This paper, motivated by this script of insights, investigates problems concerning logical operators, relations of sense, probability, entailment and their properties in natural language, constituted as inferences in the logical-cognitive-communicative interface. For that, foundations of classical-propositional-logic are brought closer together with the ones from semantics, pragmatics and an inspiring notion of relevance.

AB Text mining techniques have been widely used to process large volumes of documents. However, there is still a large gap when defining the architecture for systems with transactional elements of computational intelligence. The aim of the paper is to outline a proposed architecture to build a computational system that uses text mining techniques to index content from the database of the Official Gazette in the city of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim in the state of Espírito Santo, transforming the information previously available in natural language into a structured format that can be persisted. To validate the architecture we developed a prototype in Java accessible in the Web environment to evaluate the tool. To evaluate the tool, a case study featured a database composed of 22 documents, containing 198 normative acts from the database of the Official Gazette, in which good levels of accuracy and coverage of information retrieval were identified. This study contributes to the presentation of a hybrid architecture consisting of components of the model of transactional systems and elements of text mining, in addition to the use of software design patterns.

DE Representation of Information; Photographs; Taxonomy; Folksonomy	
AB Abstract Folksonomy is characterized as a democratic and interactive feature as far as the representation of documents online is concerned. In what regards the treatment of photographs, the use of folksonomy becomes a current issue due to the accuracy and specificities in access points, the representation by means of natural language and the promotion of collective intelligence. Yet, the conceptual polysemy and the lack of control of vocabulary both imply disadvantages concerning the effectiveness of the information retrieval systems in use by folksonomy; thus substantiating the prominence of controlled vocabulary in the representation of information. In this context, the purpose of this study is to indicate and to bring forward the adjustment of the advantages of folksonomy and taxonomy in the representation of the content of photographs. The methodology employed has mainly to do with literature review in the areas of Information Science, Art, History and Technology for the elaboration of the theoretical basis for the present study. Furthermore, this contributed to the identification of case studies. The investigation provided satisfactory results regarding the convergence of folksonomy and taxonomy, i.e., in the adequacy of users’ contributes (by means of tags, descriptions and/or comments) to the controlled vocabularies adopted in the representation and retrieval of information by means of photograph documents, textual ones and documents of any other gender.

AB Abstract The proposal presented in this study seeks to properly represent natural language to ontologies and vice-versa. Therefore, the semi-automatic creation of a lexical database in Brazilian Portuguese containing morphological, syntactic, and semantic information that can be read by machines was proposed, allowing the link between structured and unstructured data and its integration into an information retrieval model to improve precision. The results obtained demonstrated that the methodology can be used in the risco financeiro (financial risk) domain in Portuguese for the construction of an ontology and the lexical-semantic database and the proposal of a semantic information retrieval model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, documents containing the main definitions of the financial risk domain were selected and indexed with and without semantic annotation. To enable the comparison between the approaches, two databases were created based on the texts with the semantic annotations to represent the semantic search. The first one represents the traditional search and the second contained the index built based on the texts with the semantic annotations to represent the semantic search. The evaluation of the proposal was based on recall and precision. The queries submitted to the model showed that the semantic search outperforms the traditional search and validates the methodology used. Although more complex, the procedure proposed can be used in all kinds of domains.

AB In addition to the natural language, human beings hold this intuitive sense of counting. We have the ability to determine the number of objects in a small collection and carry out simple additions and subtractions without direct instruction. By the age of ten, a child understands about 10’000 words and speaks its native language with 95% accuracy. However, by the age of eleven, some children already claim that they do not understand mathematics. Why is that so? One reason is that spoken language and number sense are survival skills but abstract mathematics is not. This article presents a review of literature on the teaching of mathematics. Which web of interactions is established in the teaching-learning process of this subject? How much of what has been said and written about this process is merely a myth? This piece of writing aims at contributing in some way to the demystification and improvement of success in mathematics. It is, therefore, essential to understand the structural framework of theoretical research on the various approaches on the term of learning and specifically on the difficulties in learning mathematics. This implies reviewing a set of internal (brain function, spoken language and learning style) and external constraints (socio-cultural factors and teaching styles).

AB Automated code generation is fostered by several software development methods. This generation is often supplied by well-known CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools. However, automation is still so far and some CASE tools are complemented by non-standard modeling projects. In this paper, we conceptualize projects related to automated code generation, starting from discourse representations in either controlled or natural language, or in conceptual schemas. In this way, we present a graphical summary of crucial concepts related to this issue, by means of a state-of-the-art review. We conclude that automated code generation usually begins from solution-based representations of the problem instead of domain-based representations. Also, we summarize that these starting points are misunderstood by the client and this situation leads to poor validation in early stages of software development lifecycle.

AB Abstract Requirements Engineering is considered the most important phase of the life cycle of software products because it specifies the needs of the customers, and it is also the basis for the execution of the other phases of software engineering. The models currently used to perform the requirements elicitation have been proposed and widely documented, but they are focused only on the techniques to collect information, disregarding the activity of properly documenting this information. Moreover, to structure the requirements specification, natural language continues to be used as a means of communication and understanding with the customer. Due to the ambiguities caused by this language, its interpretation becomes difficult, and this leads to reprocesses in the later stages of the software life cycle. According to the above, it is necessary for software development organizations to consider formalizing the process of requirements elicitation if they wish to make their development process more efficient. A literature review is carried out in this paper to determine the process and evolution of the formal methods from the requirements engineering perspective.

AB Abstract The article presents the results of a research about learning the special elements in a triangle in Euclidean geometry, carried out with tenth grade students of a school in Tunja, aged between 14 and 17. The conjecturing and the characterization of these elements were analyzed based on the exploration of dynamic geometry environments designed in GeoGebra. The methodology was qualitative with descriptive-interpretative characteristics. The proposal is based on Bruner's learning by discovery approach. The students progressed in their intuitive thinking by implementing activities focused on visualization, mediated by dynamic drawings. The results show that students learned about special lines and points in a triangle: they identified these in the graphic representation, prioritized the use of natural language, conjectured about their properties and discovered relations and properties in triangles; which caused significant learning. Thus, they advanced in the development of spatial thinking. An important element was the development of the students' digital competence with the use of GeoGebra.

AB Although scientific electronic journals are recognized as a medium for scholarly publication in the digital environment, they are still based on the printed pattern. The textual format of articles in natural language prevents the semantic processing of that content by computer programs. The semantics and expressive power of search strategies for retrieving content in modern online bibliographic systems of digital libraries, repositories, and databases are still limited. OBJECTIVES: to identify and analyze experiences that involve Semantic Web technologies and Web 2.0 to provide direct access to the semantic content of digital scientific articles and expand the interaction between authors and readers on the Web. METHODOLOGY: approach (qualitative), type of research (descriptive, exploratory), techniques used (bibliographic and documentary research). RESULTS: Semantic Web technologies represent an advance towards the semantic retrieval and processing in the digital environment; software agents that run “inferences” and more sophisticated tasks go beyond conventional digital publication, surpassing the previously used traditional textual and linear reading format, search engines, and browsing. The effective use of Web 2.0 technologies facilitates the relationship and the activities developed by the researcher in the digital environment. Metrics based on these activities can inform measures of faster impact and complement traditional citation metrics, outlining a new scenario for Scientometrics. CONCLUSION: (10) experiments are applied to the Biomedical area, (11) use Semantic Web technologies, (6) use Web 2.0 tools; (13) are already in operation, (4) are considered theoretical proposals, and (5) are still defined as prototypes.

DE artificial Intelligence; physician-patient relationship; use of technologies; pattern recognition; decision support systems; multiprofessional teams; medical practice; medical education; flexible learning	
AB ABSTRACT Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that using algorithms defined by specialists can recognize a problem, or a task to be performed, analyzing data and taking decisions simulating the human being. Decision support systems were developed decades ago but were reemphasized as a consequence of the incredible increase in computer storage and data processing, creating the concept of “big data”. AI is already part of a large number of activities in sectors like commerce, banking, transportation, communication, and administration of human and material resources. The impact of AI in health allows the analysis of data banks such as birth, death, diseases of compulsory declaration, hospitalization of patients and data registered in electronic health records, indicating the prevalence and evolution of diseases, anticipating epidemic outbreaks and proposing preventive measures to be taking by the population. Picture analysis and pattern recognition of radiologic, dermatologic and ophthalmologic images is being now widely used. The processing of medical records is being also done to discuss cases and detect inconsistencies between diagnosis, complementary tests requested, and treatment prescribed. The indication that 32% of medical errors in the USA were due to inadequate time for patient assessment, resulting in less accurate diagnosis, not recognition of a problem, or the urgency of the case, has made urgent a reappraisal of the patient-physician relationship, trying to reserve time in the consultation for the physician hear, discuss the case and orient the patient. The use of natural language in the registration of patient data in electronic medical records, employment of computers and internet to communicate with patients, use of data collected in wearable devices, telemedicine, multi-professional team work in the delivery of health care, are proposals to optimize the medical attention to patients. The redefinition of medical practice will result, consequently, in the reform of the medical graduation. The American Medical Association established in 2013 a medical school consortium (“the work of the AMA accelerating change in medical education”) to foster these curricular changes needed to graduate physicians able to cope with innovation and artificial intelligence. The author makes considerations on medical graduation, proposing a core curriculum that will provide the competencies of a general practitioner, which will be complemented by flexible courses to take into consideration students’ orientations.

DE Concept of function; Semiotic representation of a function; Connections between representations; Concept image of a function; Concept definition of a function	
AB This article presents a study focused on the understanding of the concept of function by students of 10th grade. It studies the connections that students establish among the various representations of a function, mobilizing and linking his concepts definition and image of a function, when solving problem-solving tasks, exploratory and investigative tasks and using the graphing calculator, oriented by the teacher. It also studies the importance of multiple representations for the development of the learning of the concept of function. It aims to identify and understand, also, the difficulties that students manifest in the learning of functions, knowing better the connections made by students between the various representations of functions considered. It follows the theory defined by Duval (register of semiotic representation) and the cognitive theory of Vinner (concept image and concept definition). Students worked in classes of mathematics in an environment of problem solving, exploratory and investigative tasks and using the graphing calculator. The research methodology adopted is a qualitative and interpretative. Data collection included an initial questionnaire, reports written by students in classrooms throughout the didactic unit ''functions'' and an interview with a couple of students after the apprentice. The results indicate that the coordination that students make between the various registers of representation of a function and of different functions allows them to achieve different perspectives of a function. The cognitive paradox of mathematical understanding was highlighted by the students through the coordination that they made of the records of semiotic representations (natural language, algebraic, tabular and graphic), which allowed them to stop confusing the mathematical object function with its representation, and also achieve a strong convergence of the concept image to the concept definition of function.

TI DISCOURAGING THE DEMAND THAT FOSTERS SEX TRAFFICKING: COLLABORATION THROUGH AUGMENTED INTELLIGENCE
SO SOCIETIES
DE artificial intelligence;DE augmented intelligence;DE demand reduction;DE prostitution;DE sex trafficking;DE technology;AB Augmented intelligence—as the fusion of human and artificial intelligence—is effectively being employed in response to a spectrum of risks and crimes that stem from the online sexual exploitation marketplace. As part of a study that was sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation has documented 15 tactics that have been used in more than 2650 US cities and counties to deter sex buyers from engaging with prostitution and sex trafficking systems. One of these tactics, technology-based enforcement and deterrence methods, has been used in more than 78 locations in the United States. This paper explores the issue of technology-facilitated trafficking in the online sexual exploitation marketplace and juxtaposes this with the use of augmented intelligence in collaborative responses to these crimes. Illustrative case studies are presented that describe how two organizations employ technology that utilizes the complementary strengths of humans and machines to deter sex buyers at the point of purchase. The human(e) touch of these organizations, combined with artificial intelligence, natural language processing, constructed websites, photos, and mobile technology, show significant potential for operational scaling, and provide a template for consideration by law enforcement agencies, criminal justice systems, and the larger multidisciplinary counter-trafficking community for collaborative replication in other settings. © 2023 by the author.

TI CROWD CONTROL, PLANNING, AND PREDICTION USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: AN ALERT SYSTEM FOR CITY AUTHORITIES
SO APPLIED SCIENCES (SWITZERLAND)
DE alert system;DE machine learning algorithms;DE manual annotation;DE natural language processing (NLP);DE police intelligence;DE Roman Urdu;DE sentiment analysis;DE Twitter;DE vectorization techniques;AB Modern means of communication, economic crises, and political decisions play imperative roles in reshaping political and administrative systems throughout the world. Twitter, a micro-blogging website, has gained paramount importance in terms of public opinion-sharing. Manual intelligence of law enforcement agencies (i.e., in changing situations) cannot cope in real time. Thus, to address this problem, we built an alert system for government authorities in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The alert system gathers real-time data from Twitter in English and Roman Urdu about forthcoming gatherings (protests, demonstrations, assemblies, rallies, sit-ins, marches, etc.). To determine public sentiment regarding upcoming anti-government gatherings (protests, demonstrations, assemblies, rallies, sit-ins, marches, etc.), the alert system determines the polarity of tweets. Using keywords, the system provides information for future gatherings by extracting the entities like date, time, and location from Twitter data obtained in real time. Our system was trained and tested with different machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), multinomial naïve Bayes (MNB), and Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB), along with two vectorization techniques, i.e., term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF) and count vectorization. Moreover, this paper compares the accuracy results of sentiment analysis (SA) of Twitter data by applying supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. In our research experiment, we used two data sets, i.e., a small data set of 1000 tweets and a large data set of 4000 tweets. Results showed that RF along with count vectorization performed best for the small data set with an accuracy of 82%; with the large data set, MNB along with count vectorization outperformed all other classifiers with an accuracy of 75%. Additionally, language models, e.g., bigram and trigram, were used to generate the word clouds of positive and negative words to visualize the most frequently used words. © 2023 by the authors.

It is mostly used to recover words or terms from unstructured text to comprehend the meaning present within the documents. Indian judicial systems rely on unstructured textual sources. Retrieving information by analyzing legal documents is a time-consuming task for legal professionals. Natural Language Processing and its techniques, i.e., text analytics can support in analyzing cases to a greater extent. Hence, in this paper, the authors have proposed an exploratory visualization approach to retrieve most relevant parameters found in dowry death documents, which is one of the heinous women centric crimes in recent times. The authors have applied the text analytics concepts like weighted mean, correlation matrix and clustering techniques to visualize the major parameters present in dowry death cases. The relevant comprehensive parameters assist legal professionals in deriving insights from legal cases on dowry death by clearly displaying the major parameters specified in Indian Penal Code Section 304B. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

The authors have worked on the public university as an implementation field. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the research work followed the design science research (DSR) methodology for information systems. DSR is a research paradigm wherein a designer answers questions relevant to human problems through the creation of innovative artifacts, thereby contributing new knowledge to the body of scientific evidence. The authors have adopted a techno-functional approach. The technical part consists of the development of an intelligent recommendation system that supports the choice of optimal information technology (IT) equipment for decision-makers. This intelligent recommendation system relies on a set of functional and business concepts, namely the Moroccan normative laws and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology's (COBIT) guidelines in information system governance. Findings: The modeling of business processes in public universities is established using business process model and notation (BPMN) in accordance with official regulations. The set of BPMN models constitute a powerful repository not only for business process execution but also for further optimization. Governance generally aims to reduce budgetary wastes, and the authors' recommendation system demonstrates a technical and methodological approach enabling this feature. Implementation of artificial intelligence techniques can bring great value in terms of transparency and fluidity in purchasing business process execution. Research limitations/implications: Business limitations: First, the proposed system was modeled to handle one type products, which are computer-related equipment. Hence, the authors intend to extend the model to other types of products in future works. Conversely, the system proposes optimal purchasing order and assumes that decision makers will rely on this optimal purchasing order to choose between offers. In fact, as a perspective, the authors plan to work on a complete automation of the workflow to also include vendor selection and offer validation. Technical limitations: Natural language processing (NLP) is a widely used sentiment analysis (SA) technique that enabled the authors to validate the proposed system. Even working on samples of datasets, the authors noticed NLP dependency on huge computing power. The authors intend to experiment with learning and knowledge-based SA and assess the' computing power consumption and accuracy of the analysis compared to NLP. Another technical limitation is related to the web scraping technique; in fact, the users' reviews are crucial for the authors' system. To guarantee timeliness and reliable reviews, the system has to look automatically in websites, which confront the authors with the limitations of the web scraping like the permanent changing of website structure and scraping restrictions. Practical implications: The modeling of business processes in public universities is established using BPMN in accordance with official regulations. The set of BPMN models constitute a powerful repository not only for business process execution but also for further optimization. Governance generally aims to reduce budgetary wastes, and the authors' recommendation system demonstrates a technical and methodological approach enabling this feature. Originality/value: The adopted techno-functional approach enabled the authors to bring information system governance from a highly abstract level to a practical implementation where the theoretical best practices and guidelines are transformed to a tangible application. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

SO ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SECURITY
DE Artificial intelligence;DE Bias;DE Cyber security;DE Digital forensics;DE Digital investigation;DE IoT forensics;DE Machine learning;DE National security;DE Natural language processing;AB In recent years, there has been an increasing number of cyber-attacks targeting organisations both in the public and private sectors. With an increase in the number of such attacks, combined with the added risks of the Internet of Things, organisations are finding it increasingly difficult to safeguard their systems against sophisticated and machine-speed attacks. Attackers target systems in sectors such as banking, transportation, law firms, military, academia and hospitals in order to exfiltrate sensitive and confidential data. Organisations that have been breached as a result of a successful cyber-attack will need to understand the attack in its entirety in order to be able to determine what data was compromised. A Digital Forensic investigation can assist with establishing what data was breached. To this end, this Chapter examines the potential use of Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, in automating certain tasks of the Internet of Things Forensics, such as anomaly and steganography detection. The Chapter also aims to investigate challenges in relation to algorithmic bias and transparency in military AI applications. Accordingly, general policy recommendations are offered in response to increasing transparency and reducing bias in AI algorithms intended for miliary use. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Virtual social networks are increasingly used as a means for users to express their opinions or indignation about this problem. In this article, we analyze the sentiment of users in comments shared on Twitter about police operations with great repercussions in news portals in Brazil. In this sense, we explore lexicon and machine learning models to understand the emotion in which users discuss public safety on social networks and their opinion about the work of government agencies to reduce violence in cities. Our experiments show how challenging this inference is given peculiar characteristics of the context, such as mostly negative and sarcastic expressions. Nevertheless, our best classifiers achieved accuracy and specificity (macro F1) greater than 60% for identifying sentiments polarity, indicating a promising methodology for automatically inferring public opinion about police operations. © 2022 ACM.

TI ANALYSING PRIVACY POLICIES
SO 10TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING, TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS, TECHSYS 2021
AB Privacy statements are legal documents designed to protect the interests of companies and individuals, most commonly in web services and are widely adopted way of informing users how data will be collected, stored, shared. However, the average Internet user either does not read these statements or it takes considerable amount of time and yet it's difficult to fully understand the statement content and meaning. On the other hand, the length and complexity of the privacy statements are an obstacle for regulators to verify that the requirements are applied. Utilization of natural language processing allows document's processing to be automated to some extent and thus to reduce the gap in understanding the content by the end users. A model for automated analyses of privacy policy documents based on natural language processing and machine learning is suggested in the paper. The model comprises a pre-processing stage for data retrieval and fusion of information from different sources as well as data processing stage that utilizes neural network for data classification. The neural network architecture and several groups of model parameters have been experimentally evaluated using a dataset created using five information sources of both publicly available annotated privacy policy documents and self-annotated documents. © 2022 Author(s).

Despite the frequency and relevance of legal dealings, legal documents like contracts remains elusive to non-legal professionals for the copious usage of legal jargon. There has been little advancement in making legal contracts more comprehensible. This paper presents how Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be applied to solve this problem, further considering the challenges of applying ML to the high length of contract documents and training in a low resource environment. The largest open-source contract dataset so far, the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD) is utilized. Various pre-processing experiments and hyperparameter tuning have been carried out and we successfully managed to eclipse SOTA results presented for models in the CUAD dataset trained on RoBERTa-base. Our model, A-type-RoBERTa-base achieved an AUPR score of 46.6% compared to 42.6% on the original RoBERT-base.

To improve transparency, the interpretation of a legal text can be made explicit by formalising it. However, creating formalised representations of legal texts manually is quite labour-intensive. In this paper, we describe a method to extract structured representations in the Flint language (van Doesburg and van Engers, 2019) from natural language. Automated extraction of knowledge representation not only makes the interpretation and modelling efforts more efficient, it also contributes to reducing inter-coder dependencies. The Flint language offers a formal model that enables the interpretation of legal text by describing the norms in these texts as acts, facts and duties. To extract the components of a Flint representation, we use a rule-based method and a transformer-based method. In the transformer-based method we fine-tune the last layer with annotated legal texts. The results show that the transformed-based method (80% accuracy) outperforms the rule-based method (42% accuracy) on the Dutch Aliens Act. This indicates that the transformer-based method is a promising approach of automatically extracting Flint frames. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.

TI BYSTANDERS OR CONTESTERS? WOMEN’S POLITICAL REPRESENTATION AND QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT IN THE LOCAL COUNCILS OF ALBANIA
SO JOURNAL OF WOMEN, POLITICS AND POLICY
DE accountability;DE Gender quotas;DE local councils;DE natural language processing;DE quality of government;AB A growing body of scholarly work underscores that the relationship between women’s political representation and quality of government is stronger in democracies than in authoritarian regimes. The relationship, however, is less clear in regimes that are neither fully-fledged democratic nor authoritarian. I investigate the gender gap in representatives’ efforts to push for improvements in the quality of government in the local councils of Albania following the implementation of gender quotas in 2015. Using the transcripts of council meetings, I identify the kind of practices that councilors challenge when holding local government officials to account, and I compare women with men. The study shows that councilors contest practices that concern law enforcement, impartiality, and transparency. Women, compared to men, are more likely to contest practices that concern transparency. The greatest gender gap is observed in councils where the implementation of gender quotas has disrupted male dominance, numerically speaking, the most. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The proposed approach can be helpful for police and other law enforcement bodies in India for controlling and preventing crime region-wise. In the proposed approach different regression models are built based on different regression algorithms, viz., random forest regression (RFR), decision tree regression (DTR), multiple linear regression (MLR), simple linear regression (SLR), and support vector regression (SVR) after pre-processing the data using MySQL Workbench and R programming. These regression models can predict 28 different types of IPC cognizable crime counts and also a total number of Indian Penal Code (IPC) cognizable crime counts region-wise, state-wise, and year-wise (for all over the country) provided the desired inputs to the model. Data visualization techniques, namely, chord diagrams and map plots, are used to visualize pre-processed data (corresponding to the years 2014 to 2020) and predicted data by the relatively best regression model for the year 2022. For the chosen data, it is concluded that Random Forest Regression (RFR), which predicts total IPC cognizable crime, fits relatively the best, with a 0.96 adjusted r squared value and a MAPE value of 0.2, and among regression models predicting region-wise theft crime count, the random forest regression-based model relatively fits the best, with an adjusted R squared value of 0.96 and a MAPE value of 0.166. These regression models predict that Andhra Pradesh state will have the highest crime counts, with Adilabad district at the top, having 31,933 predicted crime counts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI COMMONSENSE BASED TEXT MINING ON URBAN POLICY
SO LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
DE Commonsense reasoning;DE Opinion mining;DE Ordinances;DE Smart cities;DE Social media;DE Text mining;AB Local laws on urban policy, i.e., ordinances directly affect our daily life in various ways (health, business etc.), yet in practice, for many citizens they remain impervious and complex. This article focuses on an approach to make urban policy more accessible and comprehensible to the general public and to government officials, while also addressing pertinent social media postings. Due to the intricacies of the natural language, ranging from complex legalese in ordinances to informal lingo in tweets, it is practical to harness human judgment here. To this end, we mine ordinances and tweets via reasoning based on commonsense knowledge so as to better account for pragmatics and semantics in the text. Ours is pioneering work in ordinance mining, and thus there is no prior labeled training data available for learning. This gap is filled by commonsense knowledge, a prudent choice in situations involving a lack of adequate training data. The ordinance mining can be beneficial to the public in fathoming policies and to officials in assessing policy effectiveness based on public reactions. This work contributes to smart governance, leveraging transparency in governing processes via public involvement. We focus significantly on ordinances contributing to smart cities, hence an important goal is to assess how well an urban region heads towards a smart city as per its policies mapping with smart city characteristics, and the corresponding public satisfaction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

Social media can incite hatred resulting in violent crowd triggers. Hateful content against any community practice can give rise to extremism and pungent behavior. Automatic detection of hateful behavior on social media can enable law agencies to prepare for the resulting situations. The paper tries to establish the link between social media hate speeches and crowd behavior which can trigger the violence in cities. The paper proposes a novel solution to integrate the Internet of Tings (IoT) devices with social media analysis system. The proposed approach establishes a clear link between quantitative effects of community hate content on social media and resulting crowd violence in cities. We have utilized conventional deep learning architecture to classify the hate speeches and ensuing violence detection. Effective monitoring of social media speeches can be helpful in analysis of conversion of hate in to violent act. © 2021 IEEE.

Now people analyze the opinion of others before purchasing any product, hotel booking, stepping onto restaurants etc. and the respective user share their experience as a feedback towards the service. But there is no e-governance platform to obtain public opinion grievances towards covid19, government new laws, policies etc. With the growing availability and emergence of opinion rich information’s, new opportunities and challenges might arise in developing a technology for mining the huge set of public messages, opinions and alert the respective departments to take necessary actions and also nearby ambulances if its related to covid-19. To overcome this pandemic situation a natural language processing based efficient e-governance platform is demandful to detect the corona positive patients and provide transparency on the covid count and also alert the respective health ministry and nearby ambulance based on the user voice inputs. To convert the public voice messages into text, we used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). To identify respective government department responsible for the respective user voice input, we perform pre-processing, part of speech, unigram, bigram, trigram analysis and fuzzy logic (machine learning technique). After identifying the responsible department, we perform 2 methods, (1) Automatic alert e-mail and message to the government departmental officials and nearby ambulance or covid camp if the user input is related to covis19. (2) Ticketing system for public and government officials monitoring. For experimental results, we used Java based web and mobile application to execute the proposed methodology. Integration of HMM, Fuzzy logic provides promising results. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

These applications are required to adapt human-centric approach to make the most of human intuition and intelligence in Industry 4.0 automation.It calls for a transdisciplinarity research domain to investigate innovative systems with overlapping realms of Psychology, Sociology, Communication networks, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Collaborative Computing. The author at the Cognitive Systems Research Centre, London South Bank University has coined the expression '3C Systems' to refer to such artifacts which stands for 'Collabora-tive Cognitive Communication Systems.' In this article, an innovative framework for 3C Systems is proposed that is able to analyze and predict both the human as well as machine behaviors. It proactively diagnoses issues and recommends solutions without requiring any human intervention. The proposed concept of 3C Systems would potentially contribute towards 6G standardization. The automation and orchestration aspects of this research have variety of applications stretched across city infrastructures, retail, business, tourism, health, law, education and travel. A thorough insight to a broad view of 6G vision has been presented towards envisioned 3C Systems, while covering its enabling technologies. The experimental results for the proof of concept implementation has been presented. Results affirm the technical capabilities of the concept, to contribute to several industry 5.0 applications including, but not limited to holographic communication, self-driving vehicles, context-aware infrastructure and personalized interfaces. © 2017 IEEE.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
DE Dynamics;DE Earthquakes;DE Dynamical approaches;DE Dynamical constraints;DE Model Selection;DE Natural languages;DE Quantitative result;DE Simon process;DE Socio-economic systems;DE Urban agglomerations;DE Computational linguistics;AB The rank-size plots of a large number of different physical and socio-economic systems are usually said to follow Zipf's law, but a unique framework for the comprehension of this ubiquitous scaling law is still lacking. Here we show that a dynamical approach is crucial: during their evolution, some systems are attracted towards Zipf's law, while others present Zipf's law only temporarily and, therefore, spuriously. A truly Zipfian dynamics is characterized by a dynamical constraint, or coherence, among the parameters of the generating PDF, and the number of elements in the system. A clear-cut example of such coherence is natural language. Our framework allows us to derive some quantitative results that go well beyond the usual Zipf's law: (i) earthquakes can evolve only incoherently and thus show Zipf's law spuriously; this allows an assessment of the largest possible magnitude of an earthquake occurring in a geographical region. (ii) We prove that Zipfian dynamics are not additive, explaining analytically why US cities evolve coherently, while world cities do not. (iii) Our concept of coherence can be used for model selection, for example, the Yule-Simon process can describe the dynamics of world countries' GDP. (iv) World cities present spurious Zipf's law and we use this property for estimating the maximal population of an urban agglomeration. © 2021 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

We compared Binary Bag of Words, Bag of Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Word2vec and Doc2vec models in different dimensions and with different hyperparameters, totaling 45 models. Our experiment consists in evaluating the result of clustering done by K-Means algorithm over the vectors created by each model. The evaluation was done both quantitatively, using clustering evaluation metrics, and qualitatively, considering relevant aspects for the application of this type of algorithm in the legal environment, such as transparency and interpretability. Our experiments were conducted in a database of 30,000 documents in Brazilian Portuguese of judicial moves of the Tribunal de Justiça do Rio Grande do Norte (TJRN). The research results suggest that the TF-IDF method seems to be the most suitable for the task, outperforming the other models in considered metrics. The other methods appear to perform equally well, with the exception of Doc2vec, which performed poorly. © 2021 IEEE.

Results of conformance checking are valid as long as normative processes correspond to actual norms. Recent developments advocate the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process model discovery from texts. We present a series of challenges in textual process discovery that limit its applicability to real norms. The challenges emerges from experiences with legal practitioners in the digitalization of administrative processes in Danish and Italian municipalities, and they need to be solved in order to provide accurate normative processes that reflect the intent of laws. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

DE Legal document;DE Text classification;DE Text segmentation;DE Authentication;DE Classification (of information);DE Information systems;DE Information use;DE Ensemble classifiers;DE Gold standards;DE Legal documents;DE Legal texts;DE Optimal points;DE Paragraph segmentation;DE Segmentation system;DE Natural language processing systems;AB In order to justify rulings, legal documents need to present facts as well as an analysis built thereon. In this paper, we present two methods to automatically extract case-relevant facts from French-language legal documents pertaining to tenant-landlord disputes. Our models consist of an ensemble that classifies a given sentence as either Fact or non-Fact, regardless of its context, and a recurrent architecture that contextually determines the class of each sentence in a given document. Both models are combined with a heuristic-based segmentation system that identifies the optimal point in the legal text where the presentation of facts ends and the analysis begins. When tested on a dataset of rulings from the Régie du Logement of the city of ANONYMOUS, the recurrent architecture achieves a better performance than the sentence ensemble classifier. The fact segmentation task produces a splitting index which can be weighted in order to favour shorter segments with few instances of non-facts or longer segments that favour the recall of facts. Our best configuration successfully segments 40% of the dataset within a single sentence of offset with respect to the gold standard. An analysis of the results leads us to believe that the commonly accepted assumption that, in legal documents, facts should precede the analysis is often not followed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

DE Internet of things;DE Large dataset;DE Linguistics;DE Machine learning;DE Smart city;DE Empirical laws;DE NAtural language processing;DE Primary objective;DE Statistical laws;DE Text normalizations;DE Tokenizing;DE Natural language processing systems;AB Empirical laws are the statistical laws that describe the relation between entities in a large dataset. They are readily found in nature, and findings have been proven by observations [1]. The primary objective of this study is to verify some of the empirical laws such as Zipf’s law, Mandelbrot’s approximation, and Heap’s law for Hindi language corpus. This involves collecting a corpus, performing text normalization, tokenizing it to get a list of words, identifying word types and their frequency, sorting and ranking the data based on frequency, and representing the relation between the frequency and rank of the word types to validate Zipf’s law and Mandelbrot’s approximation. For Heap’s law, the relation between the number of word types and tokens for different subsets of the corpus is considered. Based on our observations, the Hindi language satisfies the laws mentioned above. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

Simultaneously, researchers in natural language processing (NLP) have developed corpora and annotation schemes for extracting salient information from privacy policies, often independently of specific laws. To connect existing NLP research on privacy policies with the GDPR, we introduce a mapping from GDPR provisions to the OPP-115 annotation scheme, which serves as the basis for a growing number of projects to automatically classify privacy policy text. We show that assumptions made in the annotation scheme about the essential topics for a privacy policy reflect many of the same topics that the GDPR requires in these documents. This suggests that OPP-115 continues to be representative of the anatomy of a legally compliant privacy policy, and that the legal assumptions behind it represent the elements of data processing that ought to be disclosed within a policy for transparency. The correspondences we show between OPP-115 and the GDPR suggest the feasibility of bridging existing computational and legal research on privacy policies, benefiting both areas. © 2020 The Authors, Faculty of Law, Masaryk University and IOS Press.

Such concerns are triggered by a tension between some unique characteristics of public blockchain systems and some new data subject rights introduced in the GDPR, e.g., the data immutability and the "right to erasure"(a.k.a. "the right to be forgotten"). The aim of this work is to understand how service providers and developers behind public blockchain systems have communicated about such GDPR-related challenges to their users and how the users have perceived such GDPR-related issues. To this end, for 50 public blockchain systems whose corresponding cryptocurrency had a capital market size over $150 million, we analyzed relevant communications and discussions on the following three online channels: blog and forums posts, GitHub repositories, and discussions on Twitter. Our results show that service providers and developers of the selected public blockchain systems did not play an active role in GDPR-related online discussions on Twitter. They also did not communicate with their users about GDPR on their forums and blogs frequently, where we could identify only 56 posts out of 17,821 posts for the period we studied. Our study also reveals that only an extreme minority of the studied systems (4) mentioned GDPR in their GitHub repositories. Our work adds new evidence on the lack of transparency and active communications of the public blockchain sector on the challenging GDPR compliance issue of public blockchain systems. © 2020 ACM.

TI MACHINE LEARNING AND LAW AND ECONOMICS: A PRELIMINARY OVERVIEW
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS
DE algorithmic fairness;DE algorithmic transparency;DE artificial intelligence;DE machine learning;DE natural language processing;AB This paper provides an overview of machine learning models, as compared to traditional economic models. It also lays out emerging issues in law and economics that the machine learning methodology raises. In doing so, Asian contexts are considered. Law and economics scholarship has applied econometric models for statistical inferences, but law as social engineering often requires forward-looking predictions rather than retrospective inferences. Machine learning can be used as an alternative or supplementary tool to improve the accuracy of legal prediction by controlling out-of-sample variance along with in-sample bias and by fitting diverse models to data with non-linear or otherwise complex distribution. In the legal arena, the past experience of using economic models in antitrust and other high-stakes litigation provides a clue as to how to introduce artificial intelligence into the legal decision-making process. Law and economics is also expected to provide useful insights as to how to balance the development of the artificial intelligence technology with fundamental social values such as human rights and autonomy. © 2020 Sangchul Park and Haksoo Ko, published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.

It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.

TI ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR: DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION OF INTELLIGENT ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IN THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
SO REVISTA DE INTERNET, DERECHO Y POLITICA
DE Administrative law;DE Artificial intelligence;DE Discretion;DE Public administration;DE Responsibility;DE Transparency;AB The development of artificial intelligence is promising and there are more and more applications and programmes which, based on said AI, offer efficient solutions for carrying out all kinds of tasks. Public administration, with the final objective of contributing to appropriate consolidation of an intelligent administration which can continue to be efficient, personalised, electronic and a guarantee of citizenship rights, is progressively incorporating this technology in public services. These intelligent tools have a great capacity for improving the provision of public services, to the extent that they can process natural language or analyse high quantities of data in order to help in making public decisions, among other functions. This new administration, together with this potential of great improvements in administrative activity, is accompanied at the same time by a series of risks with a clear legal and ethical dimension. As a result, the required technological progress for the improvement of public services can come into conflict with legal security, with basic rights such as equality at the present time, privacy or the protection of personal data, or with the principles or obligations of administrative conduct; for example, the obligation of motivation, transparency or the efficiency of defence or appeal law, as it will not always be possible to know the reason for the results given by some forms of artificial intelligence. Among other regulatory challenges that need to be addressed from the point of view of administrative law, it is possible to highlight in its principal aims the range of transparency (algorithmical), the suitable motivation for decisions assisted by artificial intelligences, and responsibility in the event of damages occasioned by following or by not being aware of the results provided by algorism.

TI TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND POLICY LEGITIMIZATION: PERSPECTIVES FROM THE RISE OF BROADBAND INTERNET AS AN ESSENTIAL UTILITY IN CANADA
SO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY
AB This article investigates how the emergence of broadband Internet connectivity as an essential utility has influenced the development of public policies that aim to promote universal access to basic communications services in Canada. We utilize quantitative Natural Language Processing (NLP)/content analysis techniques to map the evolution of conceptual emphasis by stakeholders in their formal submissions to the telecom regulator along a series of public proceedings between 2009 and 2016. The analysis documents that the growing essentiality of broadband Internet access as an enabler of social and economic activities made its quality and affordability questions with broad economic and policy relevance that cross the traditional conceptualization of universal access in terms of the rural-urban digital divide. The case study offers a novel explanation for reliance on formal public consultation processes in administrative law in terms of policy innovation: Opening communication channels with the public can be valuable for enabling policymakers legitimize regulatory adjustments necessitated by technological change. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR DETECTING PROSTITUTION ACTIVITY IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA
SO APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
DE Machine learning;DE Natural language processing;DE Phoenix;DE Prostitution;DE Spatial analysis;DE crime;DE language;DE law enforcement;DE machine learning;DE prostitution;DE spatial analysis;DE Arizona;DE Phoenix;DE United States;AB Prostitution has been a topic of study for decades, yet many questions remain about where prostitution occurs. Difficulty in identifying prostitution activity is often attributed to the hidden and seemingly victimless nature of the crime. Despite numerous challenges associated with policing street prostitution, these encounters become more difficult to identify when they take place indoors, especially in locations away from public view, such as hotels. The purpose of this paper is to develop a strategy for identifying hotel facilities and surrounding areas that may be experiencing elevated levels of prostitution activity using high-volume, user-generated data, namely hotel reviews written by guests and posted to Travelocity.com. A unique synthesis of methods including data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and basic spatial analysis are combined to identify facilities that may require additional law enforcement resources and/or social/health service outreach. Prostitution hotspots are identified within the city of Phoenix, Arizona and policy implications are discussed. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

With a focus on scaling up participatory approaches from local to national level, the approach extends well established and open source tools and technologies, to build mobile monitoring and analysis tools that increase transparency of law-making and implementation to citizens. This is achieved by combining open data and open services with user and citizen generated content, in order to address citizen's needs in the context of open government. Data and feeds from trusted sources are interconnected with new and re-purposed data feeds generated by users via the social web to form a meaningful, searchable, customizable, re-usable and open data-focused personalised mobile public service approach. The framework exploits the social aspects of open data, as well as the training of users, citizens and public servants to be able to understand and demand useful public open data, as well as facilitate the opening of more data. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Their forensic reports are the only existing clue for people identification and detection of possible crimes associated with them. The exchange of information among institutions about the identities of disappeared people was not a common practice. Thus, their analysis requires unsupervised techniques, mainly due to the fact that their contextual annotation is extremely time-consuming, difficult to obtain, and with high dependence on the annotator. The use of these techniques allows researchers to assist in the identification and analysis in four areas: Common causes of death, relevant body locations, personal belongings terminology, and correlations between actors such as doctors and police officers involved in the disappearances. This paper analyzes almost 3000 textual reports of missing persons in São Paulo city during the Brazilian dictatorship through unsupervised algorithms of information extraction in Portuguese, identifying named entities and relevant terminology associated with these four criteria. The analysis allowed us to observe terminological patterns relevant for people identification (e.g., presence of rings or similar personal belongings) and automate the study of correlations between actors. The proposed system acts as a first classificatory and indexing middleware of the reports and represents a feasible system that can assist researchers working in pattern search among autopsy reports. © 2019 by the authors.

We propose a semantic type taxonomy for norms in the German civil law domain consisting of nine different types focusing on functional aspects, such as Duties, Prohibitions, Permissions, etc. We performed four iterations in classifying legal norms with a rule-based approach using a manually labeled dataset, i.e., tenancy law, of the German Civil Code (n = 601). During this experiment the F 1 score continuously improved from 0.52 to 0.78. In contrast, a machine learning based approach for the classification was implemented. A performance of F 1 = 0.83 was reached. Traditionally, machine learning classifiers lack of transparency with regard to their decisions. We extended our approach using so-called local linear approximations, which is a novel technique to analyze and inspect a trained classifier’s behavior. We can show that there are significant similarities of manually crafted knowledge, i.e., rules and pattern definitions, and the trained decision structures of machine learning approaches. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

TI MODEL CARDS FOR MODEL REPORTING

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

For this purpose, a dataset consisting of German court decisions was developed. The source texts were manually annotated with 19 semantic classes: person, judge, lawyer, country, city, street, landscape, organization, company, institution, court, brand, law, ordinance, European legal norm, regulation, contract, court decision, and legal literature. The dataset consists of approx. 67,000 sentences and contains 54,000 annotated entities. The 19 fine-grained classes were automatically generalised to seven more coarse-grained classes (person, location, organization, legal norm, case-by-case regulation, court decision, and legal literature). Thus, the dataset includes two annotation variants, i.e., coarse- and fine-grained. For the task of NER, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs) were applied to the dataset as state of the art models. Three different models were developed for each of these two model families and tested with the coarse- and fine-grained annotations. The BiLSTM models achieve the best performance with an 95.46 F1 score for the fine-grained classes and 95.95 for the coarse-grained ones. The CRF models reach a maximum of 93.23 for the fine-grained classes and 93.22 for the coarse-grained ones. The work presented in this paper was carried out under the umbrella of the European project LYNX that develops a semantic platform that enables the development of various document processing and analysis applications for the legal domain. © 2019, The Author(s).

Assigning rank, s, to words according to their abundance, log s vs log n typically has a slope of minus one. That simple Zipf's law pattern also arises in the population sizes of cities, the sizes of corporations, and other patterns of abundance. By contrast, for the abundances of different biological species, the probability of a population of size n is typically proportional to 1/ n, declining exponentially for larger n, the log series pattern. This article shows that the differing patterns of Zipf's law and the log series arise as the opposing endpoints of a more general theory. The general theory follows from the generic form of all probability patterns as a consequence of conserved average values and the associated invariances of scale. To understand the common patterns of abundance, the generic form of probability distributions plus the conserved average abundance is sufficient. The general theory includes cases that are between the Zipf and log series endpoints, providing a broad framework for analyzing widely observed abundance patterns. © 2019 Frank SA.

It will reinforce certain principles related to the processing of personal data, which will also affect many projects in the field of Natural Language Processing. Perhaps most importantly, the GDPR will introduce the principle of accountability, according to which the data processor shall be able to demonstrate compliance with the new rules, and that he applies 'privacy by design and by default'. In our opinion, a well-drafted Data Management Plan (DMP) is of key importance for GDPR compliance; indeed, the trend towards the adoption of a DMP, particularly in EU-funded research projects, has been more vivid since 2017, after the extension of the Horizon 2020 Open Data Pilot. Since 2015, ELRA also proposes its own template for the Data Management Plan, which is being updated to take the new law into account. In this paper, we present the new legal framework introduced by the GDPR and propose how the new rules can be integrated in the DMP in order to increase transparency of processing, facilitate demonstration of GDPR compliance and spread good practices within the community. © LREC 2018 - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation.

For quite some time they have had to read extremely long judgements and try to pick out the useful information from them or hire legal editors to create summaries. We propose an automated text summarization system that generates short and useful summaries from lengthy judgements.

We use two approaches-a single document untrained approach and a multi-document trained approach depending on the type of input case (criminal or civil). Our data was collected from official government sites that included Supreme Court, high court and district court cases and our model achieved an average ROGUE-1 score of 0.58.

But it is difficult to manually access the crime reports to derive useful information that can provide insights to the law enforcement officers for analysing the crime trends. The present work emphasizes on a simple yet efficient two stage approach for analysing crime against women in India. Initially, the proposed framework extracts crime reports from online newspaper articles. Once the data is collected, the first stage approach provides an interesting aspect by identifying named entities like name of states, cities, person etc. from the dataset and a collection of top ten entities of various categories is ranked according to their frequency of occurrence. The preliminary assessment shows feasible results which are also compared with crime records drawn from National Crime Records Bureau. However, the identified subtypes of entities are mostly ignored whereas dealing only with the basic entities fails to provide in-depth recognition of crime trends. So considering the subtypes can really provide the prerequisites for finer distinction in the field of crime data mining. The second stage approach in the present work considers the sub-types of named entities as 'Modus Operandi' features (mode of operation) of the crime that caters exquisite perception of the crime performed against women in India. Though lot of research exists on crime analysis, considering modus operandi features is very less. The present work demonstrates the effectiveness of the method with high recall and precision for the identified named entities. © 2017 IEEE.

Among the various applications of building information modeling (BIM), we focus on automated design assessment and its rule-making process, which has been performed by both architects and software developers. Compared to the conventional rule-making approach, which is integrated with rule-checking software, our suggested mechanism (KBimLogic) of converting rule sentences from the Korean Building Act into computer-executable code (KBimCode) is a software-independent approach that separates the rule-making and rule-checking processes. We use the rule-making approach to translate the Korean Building Act into an explicit code that focuses on building permit requirements. Building permit-related regulations are defined in the Korean Building Act, but some of the sentences are ambiguous, and some implicit definitions hinder translation into an explicitly defined computer-executable form. Some building permit-related requirements vary by building type, administrative district, permitted date, and as-built date; thus, it is critical to design computable rules independent of specific proprietary software. The building permit system in Korea changes (as it does in other countries), making it critical that code compliance rules be kept up-to-date. Our work is motivated by such fundamentals and suggests a logic rule-based mechanism for use by non-programmers and a user-friendly approach to the rule-making process. The scope and major components of our research are as follows: (1) noun phrases classify building objects and associated properties from the Korean Building Act; (2) verb phrases derive high-level methods to construct the actual rule-checking body; and (3) the logic rule-based mechanism processes natural language sentences. In the actual implementation for translation, this approach has been demonstrated by each database and a GUI-based application named KBimLogic, for generating KBimCode. The KBimCode, which contains a set of specific building permit requirements translated from sentences, can be imported into our code-checking software (KBimAssess) using a specific file format. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We show that estimate of annual premature death in India is lower by 14.7% (19.2%) using NLP (integrated exposure risk function, IER) for assumption of uniform baseline mortality across India (as considered in the global burden of disease study) relative to the estimate obtained by adjusting for state-specific baseline mortality using GDP as a proxy. 486,100 (811,000) annual premature death in India is estimated using NLP (IER) risk functions after baseline mortality adjustment. 54.5% of premature death estimated using NLP risk function is attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 24.0% to ischemic heart disease (IHD), 18.5% to stroke and the remaining 3.0% to lung cancer (LC). 44,900 (5900-173,300) less premature death is expected annually, if India achieves its present annual air quality target of 40 μg m-3. Our results identify the worst affected districts in terms of ambient PM2.5 exposure and resulting annual premature death and call for initiation of long-term measures through a systematic framework of pollution and health data archive. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The huge amount of unstructured information available on blogs, forum and public institution web sites puts forward different challenges and opportunities. Starting from these considerations, in this paper we pursue a two-fold goal. Firstly we review some of the main methodologies employed in text mining and for the extraction of sentiment and emotions from textual sources. Secondly we provide an empirical application by considering the latest 20 issues of the Bank of Italy Governor's concluding remarks from 1996 to 2015. By taking advantage of the open source software package R, we show the following: 1) checking the word frequency distribution features of the documents; 2) extracting the evolution of the sentiment and the polarity orientation in the texts; 3) evaluating the evolution of an index for the readability and the formality level of the texts; 4) attempting to measure the popularity gained from the documents in the web. The results of the empirical analysis show the feasibility in extracting the main topics from the considered corpus. Moreover it is shown how to check for positive and negative terms in order to gauge the polarity of statements and whole documents. The evaluation of these synthetic indexes is quite relevant for increasing the transparency of the central banks' communications. © 2016 IEEE.

Citizens can easily access a lot of information about regulations,court orders,statutes,opinions and analytical documents. Such openness brings undeniable benefits in terms of transparency,participation and availability of new services. However,legal information overload poses new challenges,especially in the field of Legal Information Retrieval. Search result diversification has gained attention as a way to increase user satisfaction in web search. We hypothesize that such a strategy will also be beneficial for search on legal data sets. We address diversification of results in legal search by introducing legal domain specific diversification criteria and adopting several state of the art methods from the web search,network analysis and text summarization domains. We evaluate our diversification framework using a real data set from the Common Law domain that we subjectively annotated with relevance judgments for this purpose. Our findings reveal that web search diversification techniques outperform other approaches (e.g. summarizationbased,graph-based methods) in the context of legal diversification,as well as that the diversity criteria we introduce provide distinctively diverse subsets of resulting documents,thus differentiating our proposal in respect to traditional diversification techniques. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

DE Computational linguistics;DE Encoding (symbols);DE Human computer interaction;DE Human engineering;DE Public health;DE Large-scale database;DE Mobile apps;DE Natural languages;DE Semi-automatics;DE Space usage;DE Spatial data;DE User interfaces;AB Our interactions with the spaces around us are frequently defined by space usage rules (SURs) like "no smoking", "no dogs allowed", and "stay on the trail". These rules are important public health tools and help protect the environment, among other applications. However, despite their importance, no large-scale database of SURs currently exists. This prevents online/mobile maps from presenting these rules to users, as their traditional paper counterparts have been shown to do regularly. The lack of a SUR database also prevents developers from building novel SUR-based applications, e.g. mobile apps that inform users where they can smoke or walk their dog. In this paper, we present an in-development user interface to support the semi-automatic encoding of SURs expressed in natural language in documents such as laws, city ordinances, park rules, and institution FAQ pages. Our system will allow an untrained user to easily enter complex rules into a spatial data format compatible with OpenStreetMap.

TI A HYBRID ARCHITECTURE FOR DOCUMENT INDEXING OF THE MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL GAZETTE IN CACHOEIRO DE ITAPEMIRIM 
SO TRANSINFORMACAO
DE Indexing documents;DE Information retrieval;DE Official Gazette Cachoeiro de Itapemirim;DE Text mining;AB Text mining techniques have been widely used to process large volumes of documents. However, there is still a large gap when defining the architecture for systems with transactional elements of computational intelligence. The aim of the paper is to outline a proposed architecture to build a computational system that uses text mining techniques to index content from the database of the Official Gazette in the city of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim in the state of Espírito Santo, transforming the information previously available in natural language into a structured format that can be persisted. To validate the architecture we developed a prototype in Java accessible in the Web environment to evaluate the tool. To evaluate the tool, a case study featured a database composed of 22 documents, containing 198 normative acts from the database of the Official Gazette, in which good levels of accuracy and coverage of information retrieval were identified. This study contributes to the presentation of a hybrid architecture consisting of components of the model of transactional systems and elements of text mining, in addition to the use of software design patterns.

TI METALINGUISTIC NEGATION AND METAPHYSICAL AFFIRMATION
SO PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
DE Coincidence;DE Identity;DE Leibniz's Law;DE Metalinguistic negation;DE Monism;DE Pluralism;AB In a series of articles, Fine (Monist 83:357-361, 2000; Mind 112:195-234, 2003; Mind 115:1059-1082, 2006) presents some highly compelling objections to monism, the doctrine that spatially coincident objects are identical. His objections rely on Leibniz's Law and linguistic environments that appear to be immune to the standard charge of non-transparency and substitution failure. In this paper, I respond to Fine's objections on behalf of the monist. Following Schnieder (Philosophical Quarterly 56:39-54, 2006), I observe that arguments from Leibniz's Law are valid only if they involve descriptive, rather than metalinguistic, negation. Then I show that the monist is justified in treating the negation in Fine's objections as metalinguistic in nature. Along the way I make a few methodological remarks about the interaction between the study of natural language and metaphysics. I also present evidence that some of the linguistic environments which Fine relies on are, contrary to appearances, non-transparent. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Wide access to government data improves transparency and also fosters economic growth. Still, careless publication of personal data can easily lead to privacy violations. Due to these concerns, the Italian law states that even public deliberations must be anonymised for long term publication. In the context of the Trentino Open Data Project (Italy), we first analyse privacy legislation and anonymisation techniques. Then, we propose a semantic open source stack based on entity and word sense disambiguation techniques for publishing anonymised deliberations edited with Norme in Rete software. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

TI MODELING OF URBAN PLANNING ACTIONS BY COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS ON SEMANTIC 3D CITY MODELS

These actions often are adapted from measures specified in regulations or other legal documents given in natural language. Their realization involves (possibly complex) changes to specific parts of the environment. For example, the energetic retrofitting of a building typically comprises the insulation of the façade and replacement of the windows. In general, different actions or combinations of actions can be chosen for the optimization of certain key performance indicators (KPI) like the overall energy demand or CO2 emission of a city district. This requires the assessment of the applicability of the possible actions to the individual elements of the environment, their potential interferences, and their effects on the KPIs of interest. The paper presents an ontology for the formal modeling of planning actions as complex transactions on the entities of virtual 3D city models using UML. This comprises the representation of the required transactions on the underlying objects of the city model, the preconditions for the applicability of the action, the required actual resources like duration and costs if the actions would be performed in the real world. Also the affected KPIs like 'CO2 emission' or 'en-ergy demand' are enumerated together with qualitative indicators stating whether the action will have a positive, a negative, or no effect on them. The model builds upon the international standard CityGML of the Open Geospatial Consortium for the representation of semantic 3D city models which is used worldwide by an increasing number of cities, regions, and even entire countries. The proposed model allows to map the measures and actions described in legal documents and regulations (e.g. energy savings regulations) onto complex transactions on objects from virtual reality. This enables planners to work with high level transactions directly corresponding to measures and actions as described by legal frameworks instead of individually manipulating the many objects, attributes, and relationships within a geoinformation system required to simulate the outcome of a complex real world action. We illustrate the concept for the use case of strategic energy planning in an urban quarter in London where decisions on the sensible degree of retrofitting of individual buildings in an socially disadvantaged district have to be made.

We ask how natural language metaphors shape the way people reason about such social issues. In previous work, we showed that describing crime metaphorically as a beast or a virus, led people to generate different solutions to a city's crime problem. In the current series of studies, instead of asking people to generate a solution on their own, we provided them with a selection of possible solutions and asked them to choose the best ones. We found that metaphors influenced people's reasoning even when they had a set of options available to compare and select among. These findings suggest that metaphors can influence not just what solution comes to mind first, but also which solution people think is best, even when given the opportunity to explicitly compare alternatives. Further, we tested whether participants were aware of the metaphor. We found that very few participants thought the metaphor played an important part in their decision. Further, participants who had no explicit memory of the metaphor were just as much affected by the metaphor as participants who were able to remember the metaphorical frame. These findings suggest that metaphors can act covertly in reasoning. Finally, we examined the role of political affiliation on reasoning about crime. The results confirm our previous findings that Republicans are more likely to generate enforcement and punishment solutions for dealing with crime, and are less swayed by metaphor than are Democrats or Independents. © 2013 Thibodeau, Boroditsky.

Numerous existing initiatives already show the enormous potential of Semantic Web technologies concerning transparency and citizen orientation of public administration agencies. In order to reach the next step of matureness of such semantically enriched E-Government applications there arises the need for a well-defined ontology engineering process, which should be tackled by this thesis. Although there already exist a number of ontology engineering methodologies in general the decentralized nature of the public sector in Europe with its diversity in local laws and regulations is hardly any considered. Emphasizing investigations towards human-centered computing and natural language processing should empower domain-experts to autonomously develop most parts of relevant ontologies. The resulting methodology will be a crucial success factor towards the goal of the deployment of ontology-driven E-Government applications on a large-scale. © 2010 IADIS.

The process of finding named entities in a text and classifying them to a semantic type, is called named entity recognition. Resolution of named entities is the process of linking a mention of a name in text to a pre-existing database entry. This grounds the mention in something analogous to a real world entity. For example, a mention of a judge named Mary Smith might be resolved to a database entry for a specific judge of a specific district of a specific state. This recognition and resolution of named entities can be leveraged in a number of ways including providing hypertext links to information stored about a particular judge: their education, who appointed them, their other case opinions, etc. This paper discusses named entity recognition and resolution in legal documents such as US case law, depositions, and pleadings and other trial documents. The types of entities include judges, attorneys, companies, jurisdictions, and courts. We outline three methods for named entity recognition, lookup, context rules, and statistical models. We then describe an actual system for finding named entities in legal text and evaluate its accuracy. Similarly, for resolution, we discuss our blocking techniques, our resolution features, and the supervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniques we employ for the final matching. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

DE E-government;DE Modelling;DE Mutualisation;DE Parliament;DE Workflow;DE e-Government;DE Modelling techniques;DE Mutualisation;DE Natural languages;DE Parliament;DE Practical experience;DE Reference frameworks;DE Workflow;DE Models;DE Laws and legislation;AB Parliament work is regulated by a number of democratic rules about the way laws are proposed, discussed and finally voted. Despite a number variations, most parliaments share the same kind of workflow supported by one or two assemblies. Such workflows are most of the time described by a regulation stated in natural language and generally approved by the assemblies themselves. This document is subject to some interpretation, especially by the administration responsible of the day to day management. Currently this management is also on-going strong electronification with even a direct exposure of the parliamentary work on the internet for better transparency and control by the citizen. In this paper we report about our work of modelling the parliamentary workflows, starting from the official documents and in-place systems. The aim of this work is multiple: first, discover potential ambiguities and inconsistencies, then compare how similar are a number of parliaments and finally see how those models can be translated in the computer systems, especially in the perspective of the open-sourcing and mutualisation of such systems among different parliaments. Our practical experience of applying various modelling techniques is reported and discussed using two of the seven (!) parliaments running in Belgium. This comparison work relies both on a set of modelling requirements for such systems and on the SEQUAL reference framework for assessing the quality of models.

DE Information retrieval;DE Natural language;DE Search engine;DE Text mining;AB Tools such as web search engines are currently focused on the exhaustive recovery of information. These tools, although very useful in certain contexts, do not respond to the needs of public information services, which aim to be precise, dealing with requests from the public without overloading them with irrelevant information. Just as when a member of the public telephones his city's helpline he wants a single response to his question, a web tool which tries to emulate this service also needs to be precise, ideally providing only one response. To achieve this objective, in this paper we present a search engine which offers precise information to the public, allowing them to ask questions in the language with which they are most comfortable, without this affecting the quality of the service provided. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press.
