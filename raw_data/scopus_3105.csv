This article focuses on an approach to make urban policy more accessible and comprehensible to the general public and to government officials, while also addressing pertinent social media postings. Due to the intricacies of the natural language, ranging from complex legalese in ordinances to informal lingo in tweets, it is practical to harness human judgment here. To this end, we mine ordinances and tweets via reasoning based on commonsense knowledge so as to better account for pragmatics and semantics in the text. Ours is pioneering work in ordinance mining, and thus there is no prior labeled training data available for learning. This gap is filled by commonsense knowledge, a prudent choice in situations involving a lack of adequate training data. The ordinance mining can be beneficial to the public in fathoming policies and to officials in assessing policy effectiveness based on public reactions. This work contributes to smart governance, leveraging transparency in governing processes via public involvement. We focus significantly on ordinances contributing to smart cities, hence an important goal is to assess how well an urban region heads towards a smart city as per its policies mapping with smart city characteristics, and the corresponding public satisfaction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Commonsense reasoning; Opinion mining; Ordinances; Smart cities; Social media; Text mining",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 2018575, 2117308; Montclair State University","Manish Puri was supported by a Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantship from the Computer Science (CS) department at Montclair State University (MSU) as an MS student in CS.

As part of a study that was sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation has documented 15 tactics that have been used in more than 2650 US cities and counties to deter sex buyers from engaging with prostitution and sex trafficking systems. One of these tactics, technology-based enforcement and deterrence methods, has been used in more than 78 locations in the United States. This paper explores the issue of technology-facilitated trafficking in the online sexual exploitation marketplace and juxtaposes this with the use of augmented intelligence in collaborative responses to these crimes. Illustrative case studies are presented that describe how two organizations employ technology that utilizes the complementary strengths of humans and machines to deter sex buyers at the point of purchase. The human(e) touch of these organizations, combined with artificial intelligence, natural language processing, constructed websites, photos, and mobile technology, show significant potential for operational scaling, and provide a template for consideration by law enforcement agencies, criminal justice systems, and the larger multidisciplinary counter-trafficking community for collaborative replication in other settings. © 2023 by the author.","artificial intelligence; augmented intelligence; demand reduction; prostitution; sex trafficking; technology",,,,,,"U.S. Department of Justice, DOJ: :2020-75-CX-0011","This research was funded by the U.S. Department of Justice, grant number Award #:2020-75-CX-0011.",,"(2000) Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime.

Twitter, a micro-blogging website, has gained paramount importance in terms of public opinion-sharing. Manual intelligence of law enforcement agencies (i.e., in changing situations) cannot cope in real time. Thus, to address this problem, we built an alert system for government authorities in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The alert system gathers real-time data from Twitter in English and Roman Urdu about forthcoming gatherings (protests, demonstrations, assemblies, rallies, sit-ins, marches, etc.). To determine public sentiment regarding upcoming anti-government gatherings (protests, demonstrations, assemblies, rallies, sit-ins, marches, etc.), the alert system determines the polarity of tweets. Using keywords, the system provides information for future gatherings by extracting the entities like date, time, and location from Twitter data obtained in real time. Our system was trained and tested with different machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), multinomial naïve Bayes (MNB), and Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB), along with two vectorization techniques, i.e., term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF) and count vectorization. Moreover, this paper compares the accuracy results of sentiment analysis (SA) of Twitter data by applying supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. In our research experiment, we used two data sets, i.e., a small data set of 1000 tweets and a large data set of 4000 tweets. Results showed that RF along with count vectorization performed best for the small data set with an accuracy of 82%; with the large data set, MNB along with count vectorization outperformed all other classifiers with an accuracy of 75%. Additionally, language models, e.g., bigram and trigram, were used to generate the word clouds of positive and negative words to visualize the most frequently used words. © 2023 by the authors.","alert system; machine learning algorithms; manual annotation; natural language processing (NLP); police intelligence; Roman Urdu; sentiment analysis; Twitter; vectorization techniques",,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/X525716/1","This work is also supported in part by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant no.

ChatGPT is an advanced language model that uses deep learning techniques to produce human-like responses to natural language inputs. It is part of the family of generative pre-training transformer (GPT) models developed by OpenAI and is currently one of the largest publicly available language models. ChatGPT is capable of capturing the nuances and intricacies of human language, allowing it to generate appropriate and contextually relevant responses across a broad spectrum of prompts. The potential applications of ChatGPT in the medical field range from identifying potential research topics to assisting professionals in clinical and laboratory diagnosis. Additionally, it can be used to help medical students, doctors, nurses, and all members of the healthcare fraternity to know about updates and new developments in their respective fields. The development of virtual assistants to aid patients in managing their health is another important application of ChatGPT in medicine. Despite its potential applications, the use of ChatGPT and other AI tools in medical writing also poses ethical and legal concerns. These include possible infringement of copyright laws, medico-legal complications, and the need for transparency in AI-generated content. In conclusion, ChatGPT has several potential applications in the medical and healthcare fields. However, these applications come with several limitations and ethical considerations which are presented in detail along with future prospects in medicine and healthcare.

The authors have worked on the public university as an implementation field. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the research work followed the design science research (DSR) methodology for information systems. DSR is a research paradigm wherein a designer answers questions relevant to human problems through the creation of innovative artifacts, thereby contributing new knowledge to the body of scientific evidence. The authors have adopted a techno-functional approach. The technical part consists of the development of an intelligent recommendation system that supports the choice of optimal information technology (IT) equipment for decision-makers. This intelligent recommendation system relies on a set of functional and business concepts, namely the Moroccan normative laws and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology's (COBIT) guidelines in information system governance. Findings: The modeling of business processes in public universities is established using business process model and notation (BPMN) in accordance with official regulations. The set of BPMN models constitute a powerful repository not only for business process execution but also for further optimization. Governance generally aims to reduce budgetary wastes, and the authors' recommendation system demonstrates a technical and methodological approach enabling this feature. Implementation of artificial intelligence techniques can bring great value in terms of transparency and fluidity in purchasing business process execution. Research limitations/implications: Business limitations: First, the proposed system was modeled to handle one type products, which are computer-related equipment. Hence, the authors intend to extend the model to other types of products in future works. Conversely, the system proposes optimal purchasing order and assumes that decision makers will rely on this optimal purchasing order to choose between offers. In fact, as a perspective, the authors plan to work on a complete automation of the workflow to also include vendor selection and offer validation. Technical limitations: Natural language processing (NLP) is a widely used sentiment analysis (SA) technique that enabled the authors to validate the proposed system. Even working on samples of datasets, the authors noticed NLP dependency on huge computing power. The authors intend to experiment with learning and knowledge-based SA and assess the' computing power consumption and accuracy of the analysis compared to NLP. Another technical limitation is related to the web scraping technique; in fact, the users' reviews are crucial for the authors' system. To guarantee timeliness and reliable reviews, the system has to look automatically in websites, which confront the authors with the limitations of the web scraping like the permanent changing of website structure and scraping restrictions. Practical implications: The modeling of business processes in public universities is established using BPMN in accordance with official regulations. The set of BPMN models constitute a powerful repository not only for business process execution but also for further optimization. Governance generally aims to reduce budgetary wastes, and the authors' recommendation system demonstrates a technical and methodological approach enabling this feature. Originality/value: The adopted techno-functional approach enabled the authors to bring information system governance from a highly abstract level to a practical implementation where the theoretical best practices and guidelines are transformed to a tangible application. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial; Business process optimization; COBIT 2019; Intelligence; Purchasing business process","Budget control; Computing power; Decision making; Information use; Knowledge based systems; Laws and legislation; Process control; Purchasing; Recommender systems; Sales; Sentiment analysis; Transparency; Artificial; Business Process; Business process modeling; Business process optimization; Control objective for information and related technology 2019; Control objectives for information and related technologies; Intelligence; Optimisations; Public universities; Purchasing business process; Optimization",,,,,,,,"Audit, I.S., Association, C., (2018) COBIT® 2019 Framework: Introduction and Methodology, , ISACA, Schaumburg, IL; Bang, J., Hwang, D., Jung, H., Product recommendation system based on user purchase priority (2020) Journal of Information and Communication Convergence Engineering, 18 (1), pp. 55-60; Bautin, M., Vijayarenu, L., Skiena, S., (2008) International Sentiment Analysis for News and Blogs, , ICWSM; Bhatt, A., Patel, A., Chheda, H., Gawande, K., Amazon review classification and sentiment analysis (2015) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 6 (6), pp. 5107-5110; Calder, A., (2008) ISO/IEC 38500: The IT Governance Standard, , IT Governance; Cho, Y.S., Moon, S.C., Ryu, K.H., Clustering analysis by customer feature based on som for predicting purchase pattern in recommendation system (2014) Journal of the Korea Society of Computer and Information, 19 (2), pp. 193-200; Elli, M.S., Wang, Y.-F., Amazon reviews, business analytics with sentiment analysis (2016) Perceived Derived Attributes of Online Customer Reviews, , Abdulaziz, E.

With an increase in the number of such attacks, combined with the added risks of the Internet of Things, organisations are finding it increasingly difficult to safeguard their systems against sophisticated and machine-speed attacks. Attackers target systems in sectors such as banking, transportation, law firms, military, academia and hospitals in order to exfiltrate sensitive and confidential data. Organisations that have been breached as a result of a successful cyber-attack will need to understand the attack in its entirety in order to be able to determine what data was compromised. A Digital Forensic investigation can assist with establishing what data was breached. To this end, this Chapter examines the potential use of Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, in automating certain tasks of the Internet of Things Forensics, such as anomaly and steganography detection. The Chapter also aims to investigate challenges in relation to algorithmic bias and transparency in military AI applications. Accordingly, general policy recommendations are offered in response to increasing transparency and reducing bias in AI algorithms intended for miliary use. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Bias; Cyber security; Digital forensics; Digital investigation; IoT forensics; Machine learning; National security; Natural language processing",,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, Z., Shahid Khan, A., Nisar, K., Haider, I., Hassan, R., Haque, M.R., Tarmizi, S., Rodrigues, J., Anomaly detection using deep neural network for IoT architecture (2021) Applied Sciences, 11 (15), p. 7050; Al Fahdi, M., Clarke, N., Furnell, S., (2013) (2013).

In Brazil, an average rate of 20 deaths per month is estimated for every 100,000 inhabitants due to violence. Virtual social networks are increasingly used as a means for users to express their opinions or indignation about this problem. In this article, we analyze the sentiment of users in comments shared on Twitter about police operations with great repercussions in news portals in Brazil. In this sense, we explore lexicon and machine learning models to understand the emotion in which users discuss public safety on social networks and their opinion about the work of government agencies to reduce violence in cities. Our experiments show how challenging this inference is given peculiar characteristics of the context, such as mostly negative and sarcastic expressions. Nevertheless, our best classifiers achieved accuracy and specificity (macro F1) greater than 60% for identifying sentiments polarity, indicating a promising methodology for automatically inferring public opinion about police operations. © 2022 ACM.","Natural Language Processing; Police Operations; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter","Law enforcement; Learning algorithms; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Average rate; Language processing; Machine learning models; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Police operation; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Urban centers; Virtual social networks; Sentiment analysis",,,,,,,,"Fernanda Chaparro, L., Pulido, C., Rudas, J., Maria Reyes, A., Victorino, J., Angela Narvaez, L., Gómez, F., Martinez, D., Sentiment analysis of social network content to characterize the perception of security (2020) 2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM).

In this context, federated learning is one of the most influential frameworks for privacy-preserving distributed machine learning, achieving astounding results in many natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Several federated learning frameworks employ differential privacy to prevent private data leakage to unauthorized parties and malicious attackers. Many studies, however, highlight the vulnerabilities of standard federated learning to poisoning and inference, thus raising concerns about potential risks for sensitive data. To address this issue, we present SGDE, a generative data exchange protocol that improves user security and machine learning performance in a cross-silo federation. The core of SGDE is to share data generators with strong differential privacy guarantees trained on private data instead of communicating explicit gradient information. These generators synthesize an arbitrarily large amount of data that retain the distinctive features of private samples but differ substantially. In this work, SGDE is tested in a cross-silo federated network on images and tabular datasets, exploiting beta-variational autoencoders as data generators. From the results, the inclusion of SGDE turns out to improve task accuracy and fairness, as well as resilience to the most influential attacks on federated learning. © 2022 ACM.","Deep learning; Differential privacy; Federated learning; Generative deep learning; Gradient leakage; Privacy","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Data processing algorithms; Deep learning; Differential privacies; Federated learning; Generative deep learning; Gradient leakage; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Privacy regulation; Private data; Electronic data interchange",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 101016577; European Commission, EC","The European Commission has partially funded this work under the H2020 grant N. 101016577 AI-SPRINT: AI in Secure Privacy-pReserving computINg conTinuum.",,"Albrecht, J.P., How the gdpr will change the world (2016) European Data Protection Law Review, 2 (3), pp. 287-289. , https://doi.org/10.21552/EDPL/2016/3/4, 2016; Parasol, M., The impact of china's 2016 cyber security law on foreign technology firms, and on china's big data and smart city dreams (2018) Computer Law & Security Review, 34 (1), pp. 67-98. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2017.05.022, Feb. 2018; Li, T., Sahu, A.K., Talwalkar, A., Smith, V., Federated learning: Challenges, methods, and future directions (2020) IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 37 (3), pp. 50-60. , https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2020.2975749arXiv:1908.07873, May 2020; McMahan, H.B., Moore, E., Ramage, D., Hampson, S., Blaise, A., Arcas, Y., (2017) Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data., , arXiv:1602.05629 [cs] (Feb. 2017); Lyu, L., Yu, H., Yang, Q., (2020) Threats to Federated Learning: A Survey., , arXiv:2003.02133 [cs, stat] (March 2020); Pillutla, K., Kakade, S.M., Harchaoui, Z., (2019) Robust aggregation for federated learning, , (2019); Caldas, S., Konecny, J., McMahan, H.B., Talwalkar, A., (2018) Expanding the reach of federated learning by reducing client resource requirements, , (2018); Zhang, C., Li, S., Xia, J., Wang, W., Yan, F., Liu, Y., {Batchcrypt}: Efficient homomorphic encryption for cross-silo federated learning (2020) 2020 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC 20)., pp. 493-506; Bouacida, N., Mohapatra, P., Vulnerabilities in federated learning (2021) IEEE Access, 9, pp. 63229-63249. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3075203, 2021; Fung, C., Chris, J., Yoon, M., Beschastnikh, I., (2020) Mitigating Sybils in Federated Learning Poisoning., , arXiv:1808.04866 [cs, stat] (July 2020); Kairouz, P., McMahan, H.B., Avent, B., Bellet, A., Bennis, M., Bhagoji, A.N., Bonawitz, K., Zhao, S., (2021) Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning., , arXiv:1912.04977 [cs, stat] (March 2021); Konecný, J., McMahan, H.B., Yu, F.X., Richtárik, P., Suresh, A.T., Bacon, D., (2017) Federated Learning: Strategies for Improving Communication Efficiency., , arXiv:1610.05492 [cs] (Oct. 2017); Sattler, F., Wiedemann, S., Muller, K.-R., Samek, W., Robust and communication-efficient federated learning from non-i.i.d (2020) Data.

However, the average Internet user either does not read these statements or it takes considerable amount of time and yet it's difficult to fully understand the statement content and meaning. On the other hand, the length and complexity of the privacy statements are an obstacle for regulators to verify that the requirements are applied. Utilization of natural language processing allows document's processing to be automated to some extent and thus to reduce the gap in understanding the content by the end users. A model for automated analyses of privacy policy documents based on natural language processing and machine learning is suggested in the paper. The model comprises a pre-processing stage for data retrieval and fusion of information from different sources as well as data processing stage that utilizes neural network for data classification.

Based on these observations, the present work discusses how the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods may harvest valuable knowledge about citizen-government communication in user profiling and satisfaction inference tasks. More specifically, from a large text dataset of this kind, we build a number of models using a range of supervised machine learning methods - including bidirectional long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), pre-trained context-sensitive embeddings (BERT) and others - and show that these outperform textual and non-textual baseline alternatives alike. This outcome makes a case in favour of NLP methods for these tasks, and paves the way for further applications in the public information access domain. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","E-government; Information access; Natural language processing; Text classification","Information retrieval; Large dataset; Natural language processing systems; Supervised learning; Computational model; Context sensitive; Government communication; NAtural language processing; Public information; Research opportunities; Short term memory; Supervised machine learning; Learning systems",,,,,"Universidade de São Paulo, USP: 668/2018; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, UFRN","The third author received support from the University of São Paulo PRP grant nr. 668/2018.","The authors are grateful to Dr Sidney Evaldo Leal and Dr Sandra Maria Alu?sio (USP) for the Coh-Metrix-Port feature extraction, and to Dr Elias Jacob de Menezes Neto (UFRN) for providing us with an early version of the present corpus.

Despite the frequency and relevance of legal dealings, legal documents like contracts remains elusive to non-legal professionals for the copious usage of legal jargon. There has been little advancement in making legal contracts more comprehensible. This paper presents how Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be applied to solve this problem, further considering the challenges of applying ML to the high length of contract documents and training in a low resource environment. The largest open-source contract dataset so far, the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD) is utilized. Various pre-processing experiments and hyperparameter tuning have been carried out and we successfully managed to eclipse SOTA results presented for models in the CUAD dataset trained on RoBERTa-base. Our model, A-type-RoBERTa-base achieved an AUPR score of 46.6% compared to 42.6% on the original RoBERT-base. This model is utilized in our end to end contract understanding application which is able to take a contract and highlight the clauses a user is looking to find along with it’s descriptions to aid due diligence before signing. Alongside digital, i.e. searchable, contracts the system is capable of processing scanned, i.e. non-searchable, contracts using tesseract OCR. This application is aimed to not only make contract review a comprehensible process to non-legal professionals, but also to help lawyers and attorneys more efficiently review contracts. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA).","Contract Review; CUAD; Machine Learning","Contracts; Laws and legislation; Natural language processing systems; Contract review; Contract understanding atticu dataset; Language processing; Language understanding; Learning languages; Legal contracts; Legal documents; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Open-source; Machine learning",,,,,,,,"Beltagy, I., Peters, M.

To improve transparency, the interpretation of a legal text can be made explicit by formalising it. However, creating formalised representations of legal texts manually is quite labour-intensive. In this paper, we describe a method to extract structured representations in the Flint language (van Doesburg and van Engers, 2019) from natural language. Automated extraction of knowledge representation not only makes the interpretation and modelling efforts more efficient, it also contributes to reducing inter-coder dependencies. The Flint language offers a formal model that enables the interpretation of legal text by describing the norms in these texts as acts, facts and duties. To extract the components of a Flint representation, we use a rule-based method and a transformer-based method. In the transformer-based method we fine-tune the last layer with annotated legal texts. The results show that the transformed-based method (80% accuracy) outperforms the rule-based method (42% accuracy) on the Dutch Aliens Act. This indicates that the transformer-based method is a promising approach of automatically extracting Flint frames. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.","Dutch; legislation; part-of-speech tagging; semantic role labelling; transformers","Computational linguistics; Laws and legislation; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Automated extraction; Dutch; Labour-intensive; Legal texts; Natural languages; Part of speech tagging; Parts-of-speech tagging; Rule-based method; Semantic role labeling; Transformer; Knowledge representation",,,,,"Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties, BZK","The authors would like to thank the Governmental Advisory Board on Digital Government (OBDO) and Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations for the financial support of our research.

The relationship, however, is less clear in regimes that are neither fully-fledged democratic nor authoritarian. I investigate the gender gap in representatives’ efforts to push for improvements in the quality of government in the local councils of Albania following the implementation of gender quotas in 2015. Using the transcripts of council meetings, I identify the kind of practices that councilors challenge when holding local government officials to account, and I compare women with men. The study shows that councilors contest practices that concern law enforcement, impartiality, and transparency. Women, compared to men, are more likely to contest practices that concern transparency. The greatest gender gap is observed in councils where the implementation of gender quotas has disrupted male dominance, numerically speaking, the most. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","accountability; Gender quotas; local councils; natural language processing; quality of government",,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; United Nations Development Programme, UNDP","I am grateful to Pär Zetterberg, Elin Bjarnegård, Michal Smrek, and participants in the Gender and Politics seminar at Uppsala University.

The proposed approach can be helpful for police and other law enforcement bodies in India for controlling and preventing crime region-wise. In the proposed approach different regression models are built based on different regression algorithms, viz., random forest regression (RFR), decision tree regression (DTR), multiple linear regression (MLR), simple linear regression (SLR), and support vector regression (SVR) after pre-processing the data using MySQL Workbench and R programming. These regression models can predict 28 different types of IPC cognizable crime counts and also a total number of Indian Penal Code (IPC) cognizable crime counts region-wise, state-wise, and year-wise (for all over the country) provided the desired inputs to the model. Data visualization techniques, namely, chord diagrams and map plots, are used to visualize pre-processed data (corresponding to the years 2014 to 2020) and predicted data by the relatively best regression model for the year 2022. For the chosen data, it is concluded that Random Forest Regression (RFR), which predicts total IPC cognizable crime, fits relatively the best, with a 0.96 adjusted r squared value and a MAPE value of 0.2, and among regression models predicting region-wise theft crime count, the random forest regression-based model relatively fits the best, with an adjusted R squared value of 0.96 and a MAPE value of 0.166. These regression models predict that Andhra Pradesh state will have the highest crime counts, with Adilabad district at the top, having 31,933 predicted crime counts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Decision tree regression (DTR); Indian Penal Code (IPC); Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE); Natural language processing (NLP); Random forest regression (RFR); Support vector regression (SVR)","Codes (symbols); Data handling; Data visualization; Decision trees; Forecasting; Linear regression; Natural language processing systems; Random forests; Support vector regression; Decision tree regression; Indian penal code; Language processing; Mean absolute percentage error; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Percentage error; Random forest regression; Random forests; Support vector regression; Support vector regressions; Crime",,,,,,,,"Gupta, M., Chandra, B., Gupta, M.P., A framework of intelligent decision support system for Indian police (2014) J Enterp Inf Manag, 27 (5), pp. 512-540; Himabindu, B.L., Arora, R., Prashanth, N.S., Whose problem is it anyway?

Hateful content against any community practice can give rise to extremism and pungent behavior. Automatic detection of hateful behavior on social media can enable law agencies to prepare for the resulting situations. The paper tries to establish the link between social media hate speeches and crowd behavior which can trigger the violence in cities. The paper proposes a novel solution to integrate the Internet of Tings (IoT) devices with social media analysis system. The proposed approach establishes a clear link between quantitative effects of community hate content on social media and resulting crowd violence in cities. We have utilized conventional deep learning architecture to classify the hate speeches and ensuing violence detection. Effective monitoring of social media speeches can be helpful in analysis of conversion of hate in to violent act. © 2021 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Network; Deep learning; Hate speech; Internet of Things; Natural Language Processing; Violence detection","Behavioral research; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Internet of things; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Automatic Detection; Convolutional neural network; Crowd behavior; Deep learning; Hate speech; Novel solutions; Social media; Social media analysis; Urban environments; Violence detections; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,"(2020), https://www.hinduhumanrights.info/a-definition-of-hinduphobia/, 11 02.

Now people analyze the opinion of others before purchasing any product, hotel booking, stepping onto restaurants etc. and the respective user share their experience as a feedback towards the service. But there is no e-governance platform to obtain public opinion grievances towards covid19, government new laws, policies etc. With the growing availability and emergence of opinion rich information’s, new opportunities and challenges might arise in developing a technology for mining the huge set of public messages, opinions and alert the respective departments to take necessary actions and also nearby ambulances if its related to covid-19. To overcome this pandemic situation a natural language processing based efficient e-governance platform is demandful to detect the corona positive patients and provide transparency on the covid count and also alert the respective health ministry and nearby ambulance based on the user voice inputs. To convert the public voice messages into text, we used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). To identify respective government department responsible for the respective user voice input, we perform pre-processing, part of speech, unigram, bigram, trigram analysis and fuzzy logic (machine learning technique). After identifying the responsible department, we perform 2 methods, (1) Automatic alert e-mail and message to the government departmental officials and nearby ambulance or covid camp if the user input is related to covis19. (2) Ticketing system for public and government officials monitoring. For experimental results, we used Java based web and mobile application to execute the proposed methodology. Integration of HMM, Fuzzy logic provides promising results. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Covid 19; Fuzzy logic; Hidden Markov models; Natural language processing; Speech processing","Ambulances; Computer circuits; e-government; Fuzzy logic; Hidden Markov models; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Smart city; Social aspects; Speech recognition; User experience; Government departments; Government officials; Hidden markov models (HMMs); Machine learning techniques; Mobile applications; NAtural language processing; Public opinions; Ticketing systems; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Agarwal, A., Biadsy, F., McKeown, K.R., Contextual phrase-level polarity analysis using lexical affect scoring and syntactic N-grams (2009) Proceedings of the 12Th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 24-32. , Stroudsburg, PA; Banerjee, D., Islam, K., Xue, K., Mei, G., Xiao, L., Zhang, G., Xu, R., Li, J., A deep transfer learning approach for improved post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis (2019) Knowledge and Information Systems, 60 (3), pp. 1693-1724; Benba, A., Jilbab, A., Sandabad, S., Hammouch, A., Voice signal processing for detecting possible early signs of Parkinson’s disease in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (2019) International Journal of Speech Technology, 22, pp. 121-129; Bhatt, A., Patel, A., Chheda, H., Gawande, K., Amazon review classification and sentiment analysis (2015) IJCSIT, 6 (6), pp. 5107-5110; (2012) National Institute for Smart Government, , www.nisg.orgonbehalfoftheDepartmentofElectronics&InformationTechnology,GovernmentofIndia; Erdogdu-Sakar, B., Serbes, G., Okan-Sakar, C., Analyzing the effectiveness of vocal features in early telediagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (2017) PLoS ONE, 12 (8), pp. 1-18; Faurholt-Jepsen, M., Busk, J., Frost, M., Vinberg, M., Christensen, E.M., Winther, O., Bardram, J.E., Kessing, L.V., Voice analysis as an objective state marker in bipolar disorder (2016) Translational Psychiatry, 6 (7); (2020) Frost & Sullivan: Global Smart Cities Market to Reach US$1.56 Trillion by 2020, , http://www.prnewswire.com/newsreleases/frost–sullivan-global-smart-cities-market-toreach-us156-trillion-by-2020-300001531.html, Retrieved May 30, 2016, from; Gupta, V., Lehal, G.S., A survey of text mining techniques and applications (2009) Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web Intelligence, 1 (1), pp. 60-76; Haddi, E., Liu, X., Shi, Y., The role of text preprocessing in sentiment analysis (2013) Procedia Computer Science, 17, pp. 26-32; Harrison, C., Eckman, B., Hamilton, R., Hartswick, P., Kalagnanam, J., Paraszczak, J., Williams, P., Foundations for smarter cities (2010) IBM Journal of Research and Development, 54 (4), pp. 1-16; Kim, S.-M., Hovy, E., (2004).

These applications are required to adapt human-centric approach to make the most of human intuition and intelligence in Industry 4.0 automation.It calls for a transdisciplinarity research domain to investigate innovative systems with overlapping realms of Psychology, Sociology, Communication networks, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Collaborative Computing. The author at the Cognitive Systems Research Centre, London South Bank University has coined the expression '3C Systems' to refer to such artifacts which stands for 'Collabora-tive Cognitive Communication Systems.' In this article, an innovative framework for 3C Systems is proposed that is able to analyze and predict both the human as well as machine behaviors. It proactively diagnoses issues and recommends solutions without requiring any human intervention. The proposed concept of 3C Systems would potentially contribute towards 6G standardization. The automation and orchestration aspects of this research have variety of applications stretched across city infrastructures, retail, business, tourism, health, law, education and travel. A thorough insight to a broad view of 6G vision has been presented towards envisioned 3C Systems, while covering its enabling technologies. The experimental results for the proof of concept implementation has been presented. Results affirm the technical capabilities of the concept, to contribute to several industry 5.0 applications including, but not limited to holographic communication, self-driving vehicles, context-aware infrastructure and personalized interfaces. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Leisure industry; Service industry; Sociology; Tourism; Cognitive communications; Enabling technologies; Heterogeneous environments; Human intervention; NAtural language processing; Personalized interface; Technical capabilities; Transdisciplinarity; Natural language processing systems",,,,,"Kingston University; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC","mobile computing and Industry-Academia Linkages Lead in the Division of Computer Science, School of Engineering, London South Bank University.

Moro, 2, Rome, I-00185, Italy","The rank-size plots of a large number of different physical and socio-economic systems are usually said to follow Zipf's law, but a unique framework for the comprehension of this ubiquitous scaling law is still lacking. Here we show that a dynamical approach is crucial: during their evolution, some systems are attracted towards Zipf's law, while others present Zipf's law only temporarily and, therefore, spuriously. A truly Zipfian dynamics is characterized by a dynamical constraint, or coherence, among the parameters of the generating PDF, and the number of elements in the system. A clear-cut example of such coherence is natural language. Our framework allows us to derive some quantitative results that go well beyond the usual Zipf's law: (i) earthquakes can evolve only incoherently and thus show Zipf's law spuriously; this allows an assessment of the largest possible magnitude of an earthquake occurring in a geographical region. (ii) We prove that Zipfian dynamics are not additive, explaining analytically why US cities evolve coherently, while world cities do not. (iii) Our concept of coherence can be used for model selection, for example, the Yule-Simon process can describe the dynamics of world countries' GDP. (iv) World cities present spurious Zipf's law and we use this property for estimating the maximal population of an urban agglomeration. © 2021 authors.

We compared Binary Bag of Words, Bag of Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Word2vec and Doc2vec models in different dimensions and with different hyperparameters, totaling 45 models. Our experiment consists in evaluating the result of clustering done by K-Means algorithm over the vectors created by each model. The evaluation was done both quantitatively, using clustering evaluation metrics, and qualitatively, considering relevant aspects for the application of this type of algorithm in the legal environment, such as transparency and interpretability. Our experiments were conducted in a database of 30,000 documents in Brazilian Portuguese of judicial moves of the Tribunal de Justiça do Rio Grande do Norte (TJRN). The research results suggest that the TF-IDF method seems to be the most suitable for the task, outperforming the other models in considered metrics. The other methods appear to perform equally well, with the exception of Doc2vec, which performed poorly. © 2021 IEEE.","clustering; comparison; feature extraction; law; natural language processing","Extraction; Inverse problems; K-means clustering; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Bag of words; Clusterings; Comparison; Document Clustering; Feature extraction methods; Features extraction; Law; Legal documents; Legal texts; Textual features; Feature extraction",,,,,"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This research is in part supported by CAPES - Brazilian Agency of Superior Education and CNPq - Brazilian Agency for Resarch and Development",,"(2020) Relatório Justica em Numeros, , https://www.cnj.jus.br/pesquisas-judiciarias/justica-em-numeros/, CNJ-Conselho Nacional de Justica; Górski, L., Towards legal change analysis: Clustering of polish civil code amendments (2019) ASAIL@ ICAIL; Poudyal, P., Goncalves, T., Quaresma, P., Using clustering techniques to identify arguments in legal documents (2019) ASAIL@ ICAIL; Tian, X., Fang, Y., Weng, Y., Luo, Y., Cheng, H., Wang, Z., K-means clustering for controversial issues merging in Chinese legal texts (2018) JURIX, pp. 215-219; Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, , arXiv preprint arXiv :1810.04805; Howard, J., Ruder, S., (2018) Universal language model fine-tuning for text classification, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1801.06146; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., (2013) Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1310.4546; Aguilar, J., Salazar, C., Velasco, H., Monsalve-Pulido, J., Montoya, E., Comparison and evaluation of different methods for the feature extraction from educational contents (2020) Computation, 8 (2), p. 30; Rokach, L., Maimon, O., Clustering methods (2005) Data mining and knowledge discovery handbook.

Results of conformance checking are valid as long as normative processes correspond to actual norms. Recent developments advocate the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process model discovery from texts. We present a series of challenges in textual process discovery that limit its applicability to real norms. The challenges emerges from experiences with legal practitioners in the digitalization of administrative processes in Danish and Italian municipalities, and they need to be solved in order to provide accurate normative processes that reflect the intent of laws. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

In this paper, we present two methods to automatically extract case-relevant facts from French-language legal documents pertaining to tenant-landlord disputes. Our models consist of an ensemble that classifies a given sentence as either Fact or non-Fact, regardless of its context, and a recurrent architecture that contextually determines the class of each sentence in a given document. Both models are combined with a heuristic-based segmentation system that identifies the optimal point in the legal text where the presentation of facts ends and the analysis begins. When tested on a dataset of rulings from the Régie du Logement of the city of ANONYMOUS, the recurrent architecture achieves a better performance than the sentence ensemble classifier. The fact segmentation task produces a splitting index which can be weighted in order to favour shorter segments with few instances of non-facts or longer segments that favour the recall of facts. Our best configuration successfully segments 40% of the dataset within a single sentence of offset with respect to the gold standard. An analysis of the results leads us to believe that the commonly accepted assumption that, in legal documents, facts should precede the analysis is often not followed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Legal document; Text classification; Text segmentation","Authentication; Classification (of information); Information systems; Information use; Ensemble classifiers; Gold standards; Legal documents; Legal texts; Optimal points; Paragraph segmentation; Segmentation system; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,"Supported by the CLaC Lab and the CyberJustice Lab at the University of Montréal.",,"Attardi, G., Experiments with a multilanguage non-projective dependency parser (2006) Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (Conll-X), pp. 166-170. , pp., June; Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, , arXiv preprint arXiv:, May; Cho, K., (2014) Learning Phrase Representations Using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation, , arXiv preprint arXiv:, September; Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) BERT: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.

They are readily found in nature, and findings have been proven by observations [1]. The primary objective of this study is to verify some of the empirical laws such as Zipf’s law, Mandelbrot’s approximation, and Heap’s law for Hindi language corpus. This involves collecting a corpus, performing text normalization, tokenizing it to get a list of words, identifying word types and their frequency, sorting and ranking the data based on frequency, and representing the relation between the frequency and rank of the word types to validate Zipf’s law and Mandelbrot’s approximation. For Heap’s law, the relation between the number of word types and tokens for different subsets of the corpus is considered. Based on our observations, the Hindi language satisfies the laws mentioned above. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,"Internet of things; Large dataset; Linguistics; Machine learning; Smart city; Empirical laws; NAtural language processing; Primary objective; Statistical laws; Text normalizations; Tokenizing; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,,,"Manning, C., Schtze, H., (1999) Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Chowdhury, G.G., Natural Language Processing, , Dept. of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow; Charniak, E., (1993) Statistical Language Learning, , MIT Press, Cambridge; James, A., (1996) Natural Language Understanding, , 2nd edn.

Simultaneously, researchers in natural language processing (NLP) have developed corpora and annotation schemes for extracting salient information from privacy policies, often independently of specific laws. To connect existing NLP research on privacy policies with the GDPR, we introduce a mapping from GDPR provisions to the OPP-115 annotation scheme, which serves as the basis for a growing number of projects to automatically classify privacy policy text. We show that assumptions made in the annotation scheme about the essential topics for a privacy policy reflect many of the same topics that the GDPR requires in these documents. This suggests that OPP-115 continues to be representative of the anatomy of a legally compliant privacy policy, and that the legal assumptions behind it represent the elements of data processing that ought to be disclosed within a policy for transparency. The correspondences we show between OPP-115 and the GDPR suggest the feasibility of bridging existing computational and legal research on privacy policies, benefiting both areas. © 2020 The Authors, Faculty of Law, Masaryk University and IOS Press.","Annotation; GDPR; General Data Protection Regulation; Privacy; Privacy laws; Privacy policies; Theory","Information systems; Information use; Laws and legislation; Linguistics; Mapping; Natural language processing systems; Annotation scheme; Corpus annotations; European union; General data protection regulations; Legal research; NAtural language processing; Privacy policies; Specific information; Data privacy",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: -1914444, -1914446, -1914486","This work was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation under Grants #CNS-1914444, #CNS-1914446, and #CNS-1914486, as well as the PA Space Grant Consortium Research Internship Program.",,"Bonatti, P., Kirrane, S., Petrova, I.M., Sauro, L., Schlehahn, E., (2019) The Special Usage Policy Language, , https://ai.wu.ac.at/policies/policylanguage; Harkous, H., Fawaz, K., Lebret, R., Schaub, F., Shin, K.G., Aberer, K., Polisis: Automated analysis and presentation of privacy policies using deep learning (2018) Proc.

Such concerns are triggered by a tension between some unique characteristics of public blockchain systems and some new data subject rights introduced in the GDPR, e.g., the data immutability and the ""right to erasure""(a.k.a. ""the right to be forgotten""). The aim of this work is to understand how service providers and developers behind public blockchain systems have communicated about such GDPR-related challenges to their users and how the users have perceived such GDPR-related issues. To this end, for 50 public blockchain systems whose corresponding cryptocurrency had a capital market size over $150 million, we analyzed relevant communications and discussions on the following three online channels: blog and forums posts, GitHub repositories, and discussions on Twitter. Our results show that service providers and developers of the selected public blockchain systems did not play an active role in GDPR-related online discussions on Twitter. They also did not communicate with their users about GDPR on their forums and blogs frequently, where we could identify only 56 posts out of 17,821 posts for the period we studied. Our study also reveals that only an extreme minority of the studied systems (4) mentioned GDPR in their GitHub repositories. Our work adds new evidence on the lack of transparency and active communications of the public blockchain sector on the challenging GDPR compliance issue of public blockchain systems. © 2020 ACM.","blockchain; blog; classification; data protection; distributed ledger; GDPR; GitHub; law; machine learning; natural language processing; NLP; online forum; permissionless; privacy; topic modeling; Twitter","Blockchain; Data privacy; Social networking (online); Active communications; Data subjects; Data-driven analysis; General data protection regulations; Online channels; Online discussions; Right to be forgotten; Service provider; Online systems",,,,,,,,"Cerioli, A., Barabesi, L., Cerasa, A., Menegatti, M., Perrotta, D., Newcomb-benford law and the detection of frauds in international trade (2019) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 116 (1), pp. 106-115; (2017) IFrame Applications, , https://vk.com/dev/IFrameápps, VKontakte company, Retrieved September 12, 2020 from; Allen Davis, C., Varol, O., Ferrara, E., Flammini, A., Menczer, F., Botornot: A system to evaluate social bots (2016) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web, pp. 273-274; Dickerson, J.P., Kagan, V., Subrahmanian, V.S., Using sentiment to detect bots on twitter: Are humans more opinionated than bots (2014) 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014).

It also lays out emerging issues in law and economics that the machine learning methodology raises. In doing so, Asian contexts are considered. Law and economics scholarship has applied econometric models for statistical inferences, but law as social engineering often requires forward-looking predictions rather than retrospective inferences. Machine learning can be used as an alternative or supplementary tool to improve the accuracy of legal prediction by controlling out-of-sample variance along with in-sample bias and by fitting diverse models to data with non-linear or otherwise complex distribution. In the legal arena, the past experience of using economic models in antitrust and other high-stakes litigation provides a clue as to how to introduce artificial intelligence into the legal decision-making process. Law and economics is also expected to provide useful insights as to how to balance the development of the artificial intelligence technology with fundamental social values such as human rights and autonomy. © 2020 Sangchul Park and Haksoo Ko, published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","algorithmic fairness; algorithmic transparency; artificial intelligence; machine learning; natural language processing",,,,,,,"This research was supported by the 2020 Research Fund of the Seoul National University Asia-Pacific Law Institute, donated by the Seoul National University Law Foundation.",,"Asaro, P.M., AI Ethics in Predictive Policing: From Models of Threat to an Ethics of Care (2019) IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 38 (2), pp. 40-53. , https://doi.org/10.1109/MTS.2019.2915154; Barocas, S., Selbst, A.D., Big Data's Disparate Impact (2016) California Law Review, 104 (3), pp. 671-732; Buchanan, B.G., Headrick, T.E., Some Speculation about Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning (1970) Stanford Law Review, 23, pp. 40-62; Calvano, E., Calzolari, G., Denicolò, V., Pastorello, S., Artificial Intelligence, Algorithmic Pricing and Collusion (2018) SSRN, , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3304991; Corbett-Davies, S., Pierson, E., Feller, A., Goel, S., (2017) Algorithmic Decision Making and the Cost of Fairness, pp. 797-806. , Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.309809; Deng, A., What Do We Know about Algorithmic Tacit Collusion (2018) Antitrust, 33 (1), pp. 88-95; Dressel, J., Farid, H., The Accuracy, Fairness, and Limits of Predicting Recidivism (2018) Science Advances, 4 (1). , eaao5580 https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aao5580; Ezrachi, S., Stucke, M.E., (2016) Virtual Competition, , Cambridge, MA Harvard University Press; Ezrachi, A., Stucke, M.E., Algorithmic Collusion: Problems and Counter-measures (2017) OECD Roundtable on Algorithms and Collusion DAF/COMP/WD (2017), 25, pp. 2-35. , https://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DAF/COMP/WD%282017%2925&docLanguage=En, Accessed July 14, 2020; Fagan, F., Levmore, S., The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Rules, Standards, and Judicial Discretion (2019) Southern California Law Review, 93 (1), pp. 1-36; Feldman, M., Friedler, S.A., Moeller, J., Scheidegger, C., Venkatasubramanian, S., Certifying and Removing Disparate Impact (2015) Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 259-268. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783311; Hart, H.L.A., Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals (1958) Harvard Law Review, 71 (4), pp. 593-629. , https://doi.org/10.2307/1338225; Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Friedman, J., (2009) The Elements of Statistical Learning, , 2nd ed.

It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prediction; epidemic model; hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model; natural language processing (NLP)","Epidemiology; Forecasting; Natural language processing systems; Development trends; Hybrid artificial intelligences; Infection rates; Mean absolute percentage error; NAtural language processing; Prediction research; Prevention and controls; Transmission law; Long short-term memory; artificial intelligence; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; human; natural language processing; pandemic; statistical model; virus pneumonia; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Models, Statistical; Natural Language Processing; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,,,,"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program): 2016YFB1000900","Manuscript received March 14, 2020; revised March 20, 2020; accepted March 26, 2020.

Public administration, with the final objective of contributing to appropriate consolidation of an intelligent administration which can continue to be efficient, personalised, electronic and a guarantee of citizenship rights, is progressively incorporating this technology in public services. These intelligent tools have a great capacity for improving the provision of public services, to the extent that they can process natural language or analyse high quantities of data in order to help in making public decisions, among other functions. This new administration, together with this potential of great improvements in administrative activity, is accompanied at the same time by a series of risks with a clear legal and ethical dimension. As a result, the required technological progress for the improvement of public services can come into conflict with legal security, with basic rights such as equality at the present time, privacy or the protection of personal data, or with the principles or obligations of administrative conduct; for example, the obligation of motivation, transparency or the efficiency of defence or appeal law, as it will not always be possible to know the reason for the results given by some forms of artificial intelligence. Among other regulatory challenges that need to be addressed from the point of view of administrative law, it is possible to highlight in its principal aims the range of transparency (algorithmical), the suitable motivation for decisions assisted by artificial intelligences, and responsibility in the event of damages occasioned by following or by not being aware of the results provided by algorism.

Difficulty in identifying prostitution activity is often attributed to the hidden and seemingly victimless nature of the crime. Despite numerous challenges associated with policing street prostitution, these encounters become more difficult to identify when they take place indoors, especially in locations away from public view, such as hotels. The purpose of this paper is to develop a strategy for identifying hotel facilities and surrounding areas that may be experiencing elevated levels of prostitution activity using high-volume, user-generated data, namely hotel reviews written by guests and posted to Travelocity.com. A unique synthesis of methods including data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and basic spatial analysis are combined to identify facilities that may require additional law enforcement resources and/or social/health service outreach. Prostitution hotspots are identified within the city of Phoenix, Arizona and policy implications are discussed. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Machine learning; Natural language processing; Phoenix; Prostitution; Spatial analysis","crime; language; law enforcement; machine learning; prostitution; spatial analysis; Arizona; Phoenix; United States",,,,,,,,"Anstine, J., Property Values in a Low Populated Area when Dual Noxious Facilities are Present (2003) Growth and Change, 34 (3), pp. 345-358; Barnard, M.A., Violence and vulnerability: conditions of work for streetworking prostitutes (1993) Sociology of Health & Illness, 15 (5), pp. 683-705; Benson, C., Matthews, R., Police and prostitution: Vice squads in Britain (2000) Sex for sale: Prostitution, pornography, and the sex industry, pp. 245-264. , Weitzer R, (ed), Routledge, New York; Boels, D., Verhage, A., Prostitution in the neighbourhood: impact on residents and implications for municipal regulation (2016) International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice, 46, pp. 43-56; Bogomolov, A., Lepri, B., Staiano, J., Oliver, N., Pianesi, F., Pentland, A., Once upon a crime: Towards crime prediction from demographics and mobile data (2014) Proceedings of the 16th international conference on multimodal interaction, pp. 427-434. , ACM, New York; Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., Mikolov, T., (2016) Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606, [Cs].

With a focus on scaling up participatory approaches from local to national level, the approach extends well established and open source tools and technologies, to build mobile monitoring and analysis tools that increase transparency of law-making and implementation to citizens. This is achieved by combining open data and open services with user and citizen generated content, in order to address citizen's needs in the context of open government. Data and feeds from trusted sources are interconnected with new and re-purposed data feeds generated by users via the social web to form a meaningful, searchable, customizable, re-usable and open data-focused personalised mobile public service approach. The framework exploits the social aspects of open data, as well as the training of users, citizens and public servants to be able to understand and demand useful public open data, as well as facilitate the opening of more data. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Accountability;

Their forensic reports are the only existing clue for people identification and detection of possible crimes associated with them. The exchange of information among institutions about the identities of disappeared people was not a common practice. Thus, their analysis requires unsupervised techniques, mainly due to the fact that their contextual annotation is extremely time-consuming, difficult to obtain, and with high dependence on the annotator. The use of these techniques allows researchers to assist in the identification and analysis in four areas: Common causes of death, relevant body locations, personal belongings terminology, and correlations between actors such as doctors and police officers involved in the disappearances. This paper analyzes almost 3000 textual reports of missing persons in São Paulo city during the Brazilian dictatorship through unsupervised algorithms of information extraction in Portuguese, identifying named entities and relevant terminology associated with these four criteria. The analysis allowed us to observe terminological patterns relevant for people identification (e.g., presence of rings or similar personal belongings) and automate the study of correlations between actors. The proposed system acts as a first classificatory and indexing middleware of the reports and represents a feasible system that can assist researchers working in pattern search among autopsy reports. © 2019 by the authors.","Autopsy reports; Information extraction; Named entity recognition; Terminology extraction","Forensic science; Information retrieval; Law enforcement; Middleware; Natural language processing systems; Autopsy reports; Exchange of information; Forensic identification; Named entity recognition; Terminology extraction; Unsupervised algorithms; Unsupervised information extractions; Unsupervised techniques; Terminology",,,,,"FJCI-2016-6 28032; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 722416; European Commission, EC","This research was partially funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and 5 Competitiveness under its Competitive Juan de la Cierva Postdoctoral Research Programme, grant FJCI-2016-6 28032 and from the European Union, through the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network 'CHEurope: Critical Heritage Studies and the Future of Europe' H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, grant 722416.

We propose a semantic type taxonomy for norms in the German civil law domain consisting of nine different types focusing on functional aspects, such as Duties, Prohibitions, Permissions, etc. We performed four iterations in classifying legal norms with a rule-based approach using a manually labeled dataset, i.e., tenancy law, of the German Civil Code (n = 601). During this experiment the F 1 score continuously improved from 0.52 to 0.78. In contrast, a machine learning based approach for the classification was implemented. A performance of F 1 = 0.83 was reached. Traditionally, machine learning classifiers lack of transparency with regard to their decisions. We extended our approach using so-called local linear approximations, which is a novel technique to analyze and inspect a trained classifier’s behavior. We can show that there are significant similarities of manually crafted knowledge, i.e., rules and pattern definitions, and the trained decision structures of machine learning approaches. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Classifying legal norms; Explainable machine learning; Local interpretable models; Natural language processing; Rule-based information extraction; Supervised machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Supervised learning; Automated classification; Legal norms; Local linear approximation; Machine learning approaches; Pattern definition; Rule based; Rule-based approach; Supervised machine learning; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Ashley, K.D., (2017) Artificial intelligence and legal analytics: new tools for law practice in the digital age, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Biagioli, C., Francesconi, E., Passerini, A., Montemagni, S., Soria, C., Automatic semantics extraction in law documents (2005) Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 133-140; (2008) Handbuch der Rechtsförmlichkeit, , Bundesministerium der Justiz, Berlin; Chiticariu, L., Li, Y., Reiss, F.R., Rule-based information extraction is dead! long live rule-based information extraction systems!

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Datasheets; Disaggregated evaluation; Documentation; Ethical considerations; Fairness evaluation; ML model evaluation; Model cards","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; System program documentation; Transparency; Data sheets; Disaggregated evaluation; Ethical considerations; Fairness evaluation; Model evaluation; Engineering education",,,,,,,,"Avrio, A.I., (2018) Avrio AI: AI Talent Platform, , https://www.goavrio.com/, 2018; Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., Kirchner, L., (2016) Machine Bias, , https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing, 2016; Bender, E.M., Friedman, B., Data statements for NLP: Toward mitigating system bias and enabling better science (2018) Transactions of the ACL (TACL), , 2018; Buolamwini, J., (2016) How I'M Fighting Bias in Algorithms, , https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms#t-63664, 2016; Buolamwini, J., Gebru, T., Gender shades: Intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classification (2018) Proceedings of the 1st Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency (Proceedings of Machine Learning Research), 81, pp. 77-91. , http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html, Sorelle A.

For this purpose, a dataset consisting of German court decisions was developed. The source texts were manually annotated with 19 semantic classes: person, judge, lawyer, country, city, street, landscape, organization, company, institution, court, brand, law, ordinance, European legal norm, regulation, contract, court decision, and legal literature. The dataset consists of approx. 67,000 sentences and contains 54,000 annotated entities. The 19 fine-grained classes were automatically generalised to seven more coarse-grained classes (person, location, organization, legal norm, case-by-case regulation, court decision, and legal literature). Thus, the dataset includes two annotation variants, i.e., coarse- and fine-grained. For the task of NER, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs) were applied to the dataset as state of the art models. Three different models were developed for each of these two model families and tested with the coarse- and fine-grained annotations. The BiLSTM models achieve the best performance with an 95.46 F1 score for the fine-grained classes and 95.95 for the coarse-grained ones. The CRF models reach a maximum of 93.23 for the fine-grained classes and 93.22 for the coarse-grained ones.

Assigning rank, s, to words according to their abundance, log s vs log n typically has a slope of minus one. That simple Zipf's law pattern also arises in the population sizes of cities, the sizes of corporations, and other patterns of abundance. By contrast, for the abundances of different biological species, the probability of a population of size n is typically proportional to 1/ n, declining exponentially for larger n, the log series pattern. This article shows that the differing patterns of Zipf's law and the log series arise as the opposing endpoints of a more general theory. The general theory follows from the generic form of all probability patterns as a consequence of conserved average values and the associated invariances of scale. To understand the common patterns of abundance, the generic form of probability distributions plus the conserved average abundance is sufficient. The general theory includes cases that are between the Zipf and log series endpoints, providing a broad framework for analyzing widely observed abundance patterns. © 2019 Frank SA.","Demography; Ecology; Linguistics; Probability theory; Scaling patterns","Article; log series; mathematical and statistical procedures; mathematical computing; population abundance; population size; probability; theory; Zipf law; city; data analysis; language; natural language processing; theoretical model; Cities; Data Analysis; Language; Models, Theoretical; Natural Language Processing",,,,,,,,"Fischer, H., (2011) A History of the Central Limit Theorem: From Classical to Modern Probability Theory, , Springer, New York; Kotz, S., Nadarajah, S., (2000) Extreme Value Distributions: Theory and Applications, , World Scientific, Singapore; Coles, S., (2001) An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values, , Springer, New York; Zipf, G.K., (1935) The Psycho-biology of Language, , ReferenceSource, Houghton Mifflin, Boston; Gabaix, X., Zipf’s law for cities: an explanation (1999) Q J Econ, 114 (3), pp. 739-767. , ReferenceSource; Arshad, S., Hu, S., Ashraf, B.N., Zipf’s law and city size distribution: a survey of the literature and future research agenda (2018) Physica A: Stat Mech Appl, 492, pp. 75-92; Axtell, R.L., Zipf distribution of U.S. firm sizes (2001) Science, 293 (5536), pp. 1818-1820. , 11546870; Fisher, R.A., Corbet, A.S., Williams, C.B., The relation between the number of species and the number of individuals in a random sample of an animal population (1943) J Anim Ecol, 12 (1), pp. 42-58; Baldridge, E., Harris, D.J., Xiao, X., An extensive comparison of species-abundance distribution models (2016) PeerJ, 4, p. e2823. , 28028483, 5183127; Frank, S.A., Common probability patterns arise from simple invariances (2016) Entropy, 18 (5), p. 192; Frank, S.A., Measurement invariance explains the universal law of generalization for psychological perception (2018) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 115 (39), pp. 9803-9806. , 30201714, 6166795; Frank, S.A., Smith, E., A simple derivation and classification of common probability distributions based on information symmetry and measurement scale (2011) J Evol Biol, 24 (3), pp. 469-484. , 21265914; Frank, S.A., How to read probability distributions as statements about process (2014) Entropy, 16, pp. 6059-6098; Gibrat, R., (1931) Les Inégalités Économiques, , ReferenceSource, Librairie du Recueil Sirey, Paris; Frank, S.A., (2019) Supplemental Material for “The common patterns of abundance: the log series and Zipf’s law”, , http://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2597895; Au, C., Tam, J., Transforming variables using the Dirac generalized function (1999) Am Stat, 53 (3), pp. 270-272; Frank, S.A., The invariances of power law size distributions [version 2; peer review: 2 approved] (2016) F1000Res, 5, p. 2074. , 27928497, 5115223","Frank, S.A.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, United States; email: safrank@uci.edu",,,"F1000 Research Ltd",,,,,20461402,,,"31069071","English","F1000 Res.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065659190

It will reinforce certain principles related to the processing of personal data, which will also affect many projects in the field of Natural Language Processing. Perhaps most importantly, the GDPR will introduce the principle of accountability, according to which the data processor shall be able to demonstrate compliance with the new rules, and that he applies 'privacy by design and by default'. In our opinion, a well-drafted Data Management Plan (DMP) is of key importance for GDPR compliance; indeed, the trend towards the adoption of a DMP, particularly in EU-funded research projects, has been more vivid since 2017, after the extension of the Horizon 2020 Open Data Pilot. Since 2015, ELRA also proposes its own template for the Data Management Plan, which is being updated to take the new law into account. In this paper, we present the new legal framework introduced by the GDPR and propose how the new rules can be integrated in the DMP in order to increase transparency of processing, facilitate demonstration of GDPR compliance and spread good practices within the community. © LREC 2018 - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation.

For quite some time they have had to read extremely long judgements and try to pick out the useful information from them or hire legal editors to create summaries. We propose an automated text summarization system that generates short and useful summaries from lengthy judgements. We make use of a natural language processing technique called latent semantic analysis (LSA) to capture concepts within a single document. We use two approaches-a single document untrained approach and a multi-document trained approach depending on the type of input case (criminal or civil). Our data was collected from official government sites that included Supreme Court, high court and district court cases and our model achieved an average ROGUE-1 score of 0.58. Finally, our system was approved by professional lawyers. In the future we aim to provide better continuity within our generated summaries and evaluate our system more accurately. © 2018 IEEE.","Latent semantic analysis; Legal; Natural language processing; Text summarization","Laws and legislation; Semantics; Text processing; District court; Latent Semantic Analysis; Legal; Legal editors; Multi-document; Natural languages; Supreme Court; Text summarization; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,,,"Kaikhah, K., Automatic text summarization with neural networks (2004) Intelligent Systems, 2004.

In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent economic law case retrieval system. Information retrieval technology involves several aspects: such as database management, natural language processing, machine learning, and so on. Furthermore, basic technologies in information retrieval contain Web page downloading, document processing, and file indexing. The proposed intelligent economic law case retrieval algorithm is made up of four steps: 1) Feature extraction, 2) Feature integration, 3) Estimating weights for similarity computation, and 4) Economic law case matching. Particularly, particle swarm optimization is exploited to compute weights for similarity computation. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is able to achieve high quality economic law case retrieval results. © 2018 IEEE.","Case retrieval system; Economic law; Feature extraction; Particle swarm optimization","Big data; Extraction; Feature extraction; Indexing (materials working); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Smart city; Websites; Case retrieval; Case retrieval algorithm; Database management; Design and Development; Document-processing; Feature integration; Information-retrieval technology; Similarity computation; Information retrieval",,,,,,,,"Backhaus, J.G., Lawyers economics versus economic analysis of law: A critique of professor Posners economic"" approach to law by reference to a case concerning damages for loss of earning capacity (2017) European Journal of Law and Economics, 43 (3), pp. 517-534; Black, W.K., (2014) Lawless Capitalism: The Subprime Crisis and the Case for An Economic Rule of Law Law & Society Review, 48, pp. 240-242; Cistaro, M., The interface between the EU copyright law and the thndamental economic freedoms of trade and competition in the digital single market: From the FAPL case to the decision in UsedSofi (2016) Queen Mary Journal of Intellectual Property, 6 (2), pp. 133-153; Faraguna, P., The economic crisis as a threat to the stability of law recent developments in the case law of the Italian constitutional court (2016) Hague Journal on the Rule of Law, 8 (2), pp. 249-270; Ghasemi, M., Economic analysis of pension Rinds laws for female heirs: Case of Irans civil servants pension flind (CSPF) (2013) European Journal of Law and Economics, 3 (62), pp. 407-421; Norton, F.X., Lawless capitalism: The subprime crisis, and the case for an economic rule of law (2014) Law Library Journal, 106 (3), p. 462; Peschek, J.G., Capitalism, L., The subprime crisis and the case for an economic rule of law (2014) Perspectives on Politics, 12 (3), pp. 721-723; Zewen, L., Xiaoping, D., Xiangjun, Z., (2015) Journal of Power Science and Technology, 30, pp. 22-27; Vadi, V., The migration of constitutional ideas to regional and international economic law: The case of proportionality (2015) Northwestern Journal of International Law & Business, 35 (3), pp. 557-589; Van Cleynenbreugel, P., (2016) The Constitutional Limits of the More Economic Approach the Light of the European Case Law, 53 (5), pp. 1469-1471. , An Analysis of the Commissions action in the Field of European Competition Law on the Basis of the Standards laid down in the Treaty and the Constitution, Common Market Law Review; Kizrak, M.A., Bolat, B., A musical information retrieval system for Classical Turkish Music makams (2017) Simulation-Transactions of the Society for Modeling and Simulation International, 93 (9), pp. 749-757; Behnert, C., Lewandowski, D., A framework for designing retrieval effectiveness studies of library information systems using human relevance assessments (2017) Journal of Documentation, 73 (3), pp. 509-527; Bellogin, A., Castells, P., Cantador, I., Statistical biases in Information Retrieval metrics for recommender systems (2017) Information Retrieval Journal, 20 (6), pp. 606-634; Choi, S., Seo, J., Kim, M., Kang, S., Han, S., Chrological big data curation: A study on the enhanced information retrieval system (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 11269-11277; Zhu, Y.J., Yan, E., Song, I.Y., A natural language interface to a graph-based bibliographic information retrieval system (2017) Data & Knowledge Engineering, 111, pp. 73-89; Khusro, S., Ali, S., Alam, I., Ullah, I., Performance evaluation of desktop search engines using information retrieval systems approaches (2017) Journal of Internet Technology, 18 (5), pp. 1043-1055","Zhan, R.; Economic Law College of East China University of Political Science and LawChina; email: ru7330@l63.com",,"Communication Research Institute of Changsha University of Science and Technology;Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System;et al.;Hunan Key Laboratory of Smart Highway;St. John's University;Xiamen University Tan Kah Kee College","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","3rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation, Big Data and Smart City, ICITBS 2018","25 January 2018 through 26 January 2018",,135790,,9781538642016,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

But it is difficult to manually access the crime reports to derive useful information that can provide insights to the law enforcement officers for analysing the crime trends. The present work emphasizes on a simple yet efficient two stage approach for analysing crime against women in India. Initially, the proposed framework extracts crime reports from online newspaper articles. Once the data is collected, the first stage approach provides an interesting aspect by identifying named entities like name of states, cities, person etc. from the dataset and a collection of top ten entities of various categories is ranked according to their frequency of occurrence. The preliminary assessment shows feasible results which are also compared with crime records drawn from National Crime Records Bureau. However, the identified subtypes of entities are mostly ignored whereas dealing only with the basic entities fails to provide in-depth recognition of crime trends. So considering the subtypes can really provide the prerequisites for finer distinction in the field of crime data mining. The second stage approach in the present work considers the sub-types of named entities as 'Modus Operandi' features (mode of operation) of the crime that caters exquisite perception of the crime performed against women in India. Though lot of research exists on crime analysis, considering modus operandi features is very less. The present work demonstrates the effectiveness of the method with high recall and precision for the identified named entities. © 2017 IEEE.","Crime reports; modus operandi; named entity recognition; precision; recall; text mining","Character recognition; Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Modus operandi; Named entity recognition; precision; recall; Text mining; Crime",,,,,,,,"Steven Bird, E.K., Loper, E., (2007) Natural Language Processing in Python; Pinheiro, V., Furtado, V., Pequeno, T., Nogueira, D., Natural language processing based on semantic inferentialism for extracting crime information from text (2010) IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), pp. 19-24. , June; Arulanandam, R., Savarimuthu, B.T.R., Purvis, M.A., Extracting crime information from online newspaper articles Second Australasian Web Conference (AWC 2014), 155, pp. 31-38. , Jan 2014; Michael Chau, H.C., Xu, J.J., Extracting meaningful entities from police narrative reports (2002) Annual National Conference on Digital Government Research, pp. 1-5. , May; Ku, C.H., Iriberri, A., Leroy, G., Crime information extraction from police and witness narrative reports (2008) IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security, pp. 193-198; Doquire, G., Verleysen, M., Feature selection with missing data using mutual information estimators (2012) Neurocomputing, 90, pp. 3-11. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2012.02.031, Aug; Yao, C.S.C., Shen, L., Yu, X., Improving classification accuracy using missing data filling algorithms for the criminal dataset (2016) International Journal of Hybrid Information Technology, 9 (4), pp. 367-374; Soubhik Rakshit, A.K.D., Das, P., Importance of missing value estimation in feature selection for crime analysis (2017) 4th International Springer Conference for Internet of Things for Technological Development, pp. 1-9. , April, In Press; Weir, G., Anagnostou, N., Exploring newspapers: A case study in corpus analysis (2007) ICTATLL Workshop, , August; Ku, A.I.C.H., Leroy, G., Natural language processing and egovernment: Crime information extraction from heterogeneous data sources (2008) Ninth International Conference on Digital Government Research, pp. 162-170. , May; Hafedh Shabat, K.R., Omar, N., Named entity recognition in crime using machine learning approach (2014) Information Retrieval Technology, pp. 280-288. , December; Shabat, H.A., Omar, N., Named entity recognition in crime news documents using classifiers combination (2015) Middle-East Journal of Scientific Research, 23 (6), pp. 1215-1221; Santoshi Sekine, C.N., Sudo, K., Extended named entity hierarchy (2002) Third International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2002), pp. 1818-1824. , February; Munasinghe, A.A.S., Perera, R.A.H.D., Criminal short listing and crime forecasting based on modus operandi (2010) University of Colombo School of Computing, , Tech.

Among the various applications of building information modeling (BIM), we focus on automated design assessment and its rule-making process, which has been performed by both architects and software developers. Compared to the conventional rule-making approach, which is integrated with rule-checking software, our suggested mechanism (KBimLogic) of converting rule sentences from the Korean Building Act into computer-executable code (KBimCode) is a software-independent approach that separates the rule-making and rule-checking processes. We use the rule-making approach to translate the Korean Building Act into an explicit code that focuses on building permit requirements. Building permit-related regulations are defined in the Korean Building Act, but some of the sentences are ambiguous, and some implicit definitions hinder translation into an explicitly defined computer-executable form. Some building permit-related requirements vary by building type, administrative district, permitted date, and as-built date; thus, it is critical to design computable rules independent of specific proprietary software. The building permit system in Korea changes (as it does in other countries), making it critical that code compliance rules be kept up-to-date. Our work is motivated by such fundamentals and suggests a logic rule-based mechanism for use by non-programmers and a user-friendly approach to the rule-making process. The scope and major components of our research are as follows: (1) noun phrases classify building objects and associated properties from the Korean Building Act; (2) verb phrases derive high-level methods to construct the actual rule-checking body; and (3) the logic rule-based mechanism processes natural language sentences. In the actual implementation for translation, this approach has been demonstrated by each database and a GUI-based application named KBimLogic, for generating KBimCode. The KBimCode, which contains a set of specific building permit requirements translated from sentences, can be imported into our code-checking software (KBimAssess) using a specific file format. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Automated design assessment; Building information modeling (BIM); Computer-executable form; Logic rule; Rule checking","Application programs; Building codes; Buildings; Codes (symbols); Computer circuits; Computer software; High level languages; Information theory; Laws and legislation; Reconfigurable hardware; Automated design; Building Information Model - BIM; Building legislation; High-level methods; Logic rules; Proprietary software; Rule checking; Software developer; Architectural design",,,,,"Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT","This research was supported by a grant ( 15AUDP-C067809-03 ) from the Architecture and Urban Development Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of the Korean government .",,"Eastman, C.M., Lee, J., Jeong, Y.-S., Lee, J.-K., Automatic rule-based checking of building designs (2009) Autom.

Cause-specific premature death from ambient PM2.5 exposure is poorly known for India. Here we develop a non-linear power law (NLP) function to estimate the relative risk associated with ambient PM2.5 exposure using satellite-based PM2.5 concentration (2001-2010) that is bias-corrected against coincident direct measurements. We show that estimate of annual premature death in India is lower by 14.7% (19.2%) using NLP (integrated exposure risk function, IER) for assumption of uniform baseline mortality across India (as considered in the global burden of disease study) relative to the estimate obtained by adjusting for state-specific baseline mortality using GDP as a proxy. 486,100 (811,000) annual premature death in India is estimated using NLP (IER) risk functions after baseline mortality adjustment. 54.5% of premature death estimated using NLP risk function is attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 24.0% to ischemic heart disease (IHD), 18.5% to stroke and the remaining 3.0% to lung cancer (LC). 44,900 (5900-173,300) less premature death is expected annually, if India achieves its present annual air quality target of 40 μg m-3. Our results identify the worst affected districts in terms of ambient PM2.5 exposure and resulting annual premature death and call for initiation of long-term measures through a systematic framework of pollution and health data archive. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Ambient PM2.5 exposure; Baseline mortality adjustment; Cause-specific premature death; District level statistics; India","Air quality; Health risks; Natural language processing systems; Pulmonary diseases; Ambient PM2.5 exposure; Baseline mortality adjustment; India; Level statistics; Premature death; Risk perception; air quality; ambient air; cardiovascular disease; Gross Domestic Product; mortality; particulate matter; World Health Organization; air quality; ambient air; Article; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; environmental exposure; human; India; ischemic heart disease; lung cancer; particulate matter; premature mortality; priority journal; adverse effects; analysis; cause of death; epidemiology; female; heart disease; lung tumor; male; mortality; particulate matter; India; particulate matter; Cause of Death; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; India; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Stroke",,"Particulate Matter",,,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी: DST/CCP/(NET-2)/PR-36/2012, RP2726","We acknowledge financial support from the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India through a research grant ( DST/CCP/(NET-2)/PR-36/2012(G) ) under the network program of climate change and human health, currently operational at IIT Delhi (RP2726).

The huge amount of unstructured information available on blogs, forum and public institution web sites puts forward different challenges and opportunities. Starting from these considerations, in this paper we pursue a two-fold goal. Firstly we review some of the main methodologies employed in text mining and for the extraction of sentiment and emotions from textual sources. Secondly we provide an empirical application by considering the latest 20 issues of the Bank of Italy Governor's concluding remarks from 1996 to 2015. By taking advantage of the open source software package R, we show the following: 1) checking the word frequency distribution features of the documents; 2) extracting the evolution of the sentiment and the polarity orientation in the texts; 3) evaluating the evolution of an index for the readability and the formality level of the texts; 4) attempting to measure the popularity gained from the documents in the web. The results of the empirical analysis show the feasibility in extracting the main topics from the considered corpus. Moreover it is shown how to check for positive and negative terms in order to gauge the polarity of statements and whole documents. The evaluation of these synthetic indexes is quite relevant for increasing the transparency of the central banks' communications. © 2016 IEEE.","Polarity; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Wordcloud; Zipf's Law","Big data; Extraction; Natural language processing systems; Open source software; Open systems; Software engineering; Polarity; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Wordcloud; Zipf's law; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Bholat, P.S.D., Hansen, S., Schonhardt-Bailey, C., Text mining for central banks (2015) Centre for Central Banking Studies, 33, pp. 1-19; Bing, L., Sentiment analysis and subjectivity (2010) Handbook of Natural Language Processing, , Second Edition.

Citizens can easily access a lot of information about regulations,court orders,statutes,opinions and analytical documents. Such openness brings undeniable benefits in terms of transparency,participation and availability of new services. However,legal information overload poses new challenges,especially in the field of Legal Information Retrieval. Search result diversification has gained attention as a way to increase user satisfaction in web search. We hypothesize that such a strategy will also be beneficial for search on legal data sets. We address diversification of results in legal search by introducing legal domain specific diversification criteria and adopting several state of the art methods from the web search,network analysis and text summarization domains. We evaluate our diversification framework using a real data set from the Common Law domain that we subjectively annotated with relevance judgments for this purpose. Our findings reveal that web search diversification techniques outperform other approaches (e.g. summarizationbased,graph-based methods) in the context of legal diversification,as well as that the diversity criteria we introduce provide distinctively diverse subsets of resulting documents,thus differentiating our proposal in respect to traditional diversification techniques. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Graphic methods; Information retrieval; Information systems; Natural language processing systems; Systems engineering; Websites; Graph-based methods; Legal information; Legal information retrieval; Multi dimensions; Relevance judgment; State-of-the-art methods; Text summarization; User satisfaction; Laws and legislation",,,,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Gollapudi, S., Halverson, A., Ieong, S., Diversifying search results (2009) Proceedings of WSDM 2009, pp. 5-14; Biagioli, C., Francesconi, E., Passerini, A., Montemagni, S., Soria, C., Automatic semantics extraction in law documents (2005) Proceedings of ICAIL 2005; Carbonell, J., Goldstein, J., The use of mmr,diversity-based reranking for reordering documents and producing summaries (1998) Proceedings of SIGIR 1998, pp. 335-336; Clarke, C.L.A., Kolla, M., Cormack, G.V., Vechtomova, O., Ashkan, A., Büttcher, S., Mackinnon, I., Novelty and diversity in information retrieval evaluation (2008) Proceedings of SIGIR 2008; Cronen-Townsend, S., Croft, W.B., Quantifying query ambiguity (2002) Proceedings of Human Language Technology Research 2002; Erkan, G., Radev, D.R., LexRank: Graph-based lexical centrality as salience in text summarization (2004) J.

These rules are important public health tools and help protect the environment, among other applications. However, despite their importance, no large-scale database of SURs currently exists. This prevents online/mobile maps from presenting these rules to users, as their traditional paper counterparts have been shown to do regularly. The lack of a SUR database also prevents developers from building novel SUR-based applications, e.g. mobile apps that inform users where they can smoke or walk their dog. In this paper, we present an in-development user interface to support the semi-automatic encoding of SURs expressed in natural language in documents such as laws, city ordinances, park rules, and institution FAQ pages. Our system will allow an untrained user to easily enter complex rules into a spatial data format compatible with OpenStreetMap.",,"Computational linguistics; Encoding (symbols); Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Public health; Large-scale database; Mobile apps; Natural languages; Semi-automatics; Space usage; Spatial data; User interfaces",,,,,,,,"Gelernter, J., Mushegian, N., Geo-parsing messages from microtext (2011) Transactions in GIS 15, 6, pp. 753-773; Haklay, M., How good is volunteered geographical information?

However, there is still a large gap when defining the architecture for systems with transactional elements of computational intelligence. The aim of the paper is to outline a proposed architecture to build a computational system that uses text mining techniques to index content from the database of the Official Gazette in the city of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim in the state of Espírito Santo, transforming the information previously available in natural language into a structured format that can be persisted. To validate the architecture we developed a prototype in Java accessible in the Web environment to evaluate the tool. To evaluate the tool, a case study featured a database composed of 22 documents, containing 198 normative acts from the database of the Official Gazette, in which good levels of accuracy and coverage of information retrieval were identified.

His objections rely on Leibniz's Law and linguistic environments that appear to be immune to the standard charge of non-transparency and substitution failure. In this paper, I respond to Fine's objections on behalf of the monist. Following Schnieder (Philosophical Quarterly 56:39-54, 2006), I observe that arguments from Leibniz's Law are valid only if they involve descriptive, rather than metalinguistic, negation. Then I show that the monist is justified in treating the negation in Fine's objections as metalinguistic in nature. Along the way I make a few methodological remarks about the interaction between the study of natural language and metaphysics. I also present evidence that some of the linguistic environments which Fine relies on are, contrary to appearances, non-transparent. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Coincidence; Identity; Leibniz's Law; Metalinguistic negation; Monism; Pluralism",,,,,,,,,"Chierchia, G., (1995) Dynamics of Meaning: Anaphora, Presupposition, and the Theory of Grammar, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Crimmins, M., Hesperus and phosphorus: Sense, pretense, and reference (1998) Philosophical Review, 107, pp. 1-47; Elbourne, P., (2005) Situations and Individuals, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Evans, G., Pronouns, quantifiers, and relative clauses (I) (1977) Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 7, pp. 467-536; Fine, K., A counterexample to Locke's thesis (2000) Monist, 83, pp. 357-361; Fine, K., The non-identity of a material thing and its matter (2003) Mind, 112, pp. 195-234; Fine, K., Arguing for non-identity: A response to King and Frances (2006) Mind, 115, pp. 1059-1082; Frege, G., (1892) On Sense and Reference, , Reprinted in Beaney, M.

These actions often are adapted from measures specified in regulations or other legal documents given in natural language. Their realization involves (possibly complex) changes to specific parts of the environment. For example, the energetic retrofitting of a building typically comprises the insulation of the façade and replacement of the windows. In general, different actions or combinations of actions can be chosen for the optimization of certain key performance indicators (KPI) like the overall energy demand or CO2 emission of a city district. This requires the assessment of the applicability of the possible actions to the individual elements of the environment, their potential interferences, and their effects on the KPIs of interest. The paper presents an ontology for the formal modeling of planning actions as complex transactions on the entities of virtual 3D city models using UML. This comprises the representation of the required transactions on the underlying objects of the city model, the preconditions for the applicability of the action, the required actual resources like duration and costs if the actions would be performed in the real world. Also the affected KPIs like 'CO2 emission' or 'en-ergy demand' are enumerated together with qualitative indicators stating whether the action will have a positive, a negative, or no effect on them. The model builds upon the international standard CityGML of the Open Geospatial Consortium for the representation of semantic 3D city models which is used worldwide by an increasing number of cities, regions, and even entire countries. The proposed model allows to map the measures and actions described in legal documents and regulations (e.g. energy savings regulations) onto complex transactions on objects from virtual reality. This enables planners to work with high level transactions directly corresponding to measures and actions as described by legal frameworks instead of individually manipulating the many objects, attributes, and relationships within a geoinformation system required to simulate the outcome of a complex real world action.

We ask how natural language metaphors shape the way people reason about such social issues. In previous work, we showed that describing crime metaphorically as a beast or a virus, led people to generate different solutions to a city's crime problem. In the current series of studies, instead of asking people to generate a solution on their own, we provided them with a selection of possible solutions and asked them to choose the best ones. We found that metaphors influenced people's reasoning even when they had a set of options available to compare and select among. These findings suggest that metaphors can influence not just what solution comes to mind first, but also which solution people think is best, even when given the opportunity to explicitly compare alternatives. Further, we tested whether participants were aware of the metaphor. We found that very few participants thought the metaphor played an important part in their decision. Further, participants who had no explicit memory of the metaphor were just as much affected by the metaphor as participants who were able to remember the metaphorical frame. These findings suggest that metaphors can act covertly in reasoning. Finally, we examined the role of political affiliation on reasoning about crime. The results confirm our previous findings that Republicans are more likely to generate enforcement and punishment solutions for dealing with crime, and are less swayed by metaphor than are Democrats or Independents. © 2013 Thibodeau, Boroditsky.",,"article; crime; decision making; human; law enforcement; memory; natural language processing; political system; politics; problem solving; punishment; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude; Crime; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Memory; Metaphor; Middle Aged; Politics; Problem Solving; Regression Analysis; Social Behavior; Thinking; Young Adult",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1058119",,,"Converse, P.E., The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics (1964) Idealogy and Discontent, pp. 206-261. , In: Apter DE, editor,New York: Free Press; Delli Carpini, M.X., Keeter, S., What should be learned through service learning (2000) Political Science and Politics, 33, pp. 635-637; Lakoff, G., (2002) Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think; Krugman, P., Block that metaphor (2010) The New York Times, , http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/block-that-metaphor/, Available,Accessed 2012 Nov 27; Schon, D., Generative metaphor: A perspective on problem-setting in social policy (1979) Metaphor and Thought, pp. 137-163. , Ortony A, editor, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Schon, D., Rein, M., (1995) Frame Reflection: Toward the Resolution of Intractable Policy Controversies, , New York: Basic Books; Thibodeau, P.H., Boroditsy, L., Metaphors we think with: The role of metaphor in reasoning (2011) PLoS ONE, 6, pp. e16782; Benet-Martinez, V., John, O.P., Los cinco grandes across cultures and ethnic groups: Multitrait-multimethod analyses of the Big Five in Spanish and English (1998) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75, pp. 729-750; John, O.P., Donahue, E.M., Kentle, R.L., (1991) The Big Five Inventory, , Berkeley, CA: University of California at Berkeley, Institute of Personality and Social Research; John, O.P., Naumann, L.P., Soto, C.J., Paradigm shift to the integrative Big Five trait taxonomy: History, measurement, and conceptual issues (2008) Handbook of Personality: Theory and Research, pp. 114-158. , In: John OP, Robbins RW, Pervin LA, editors.

Numerous existing initiatives already show the enormous potential of Semantic Web technologies concerning transparency and citizen orientation of public administration agencies. In order to reach the next step of matureness of such semantically enriched E-Government applications there arises the need for a well-defined ontology engineering process, which should be tackled by this thesis. Although there already exist a number of ontology engineering methodologies in general the decentralized nature of the public sector in Europe with its diversity in local laws and regulations is hardly any considered. Emphasizing investigations towards human-centered computing and natural language processing should empower domain-experts to autonomously develop most parts of relevant ontologies. The resulting methodology will be a crucial success factor towards the goal of the deployment of ontology-driven E-Government applications on a large-scale. © 2010 IADIS.","Domain modeling; E-government; Human-centered computing; Ontology engineering methodology","Domain modeling; e-Government; E-Government applications; Human-centered computing; Local laws; NAtural language processing; Ontology engineering; Public administration; Public sector; Semantic Web technology; Success factors; Computational linguistics; Government data processing; Laws and legislation; Natural language processing systems; Management",,,,,,,,"Corcho, O., Fernandez-Lopez, M., Gomez-Perez, A., Methodologies, tools, and languages for building ontologies.

The process of finding named entities in a text and classifying them to a semantic type, is called named entity recognition. Resolution of named entities is the process of linking a mention of a name in text to a pre-existing database entry. This grounds the mention in something analogous to a real world entity. For example, a mention of a judge named Mary Smith might be resolved to a database entry for a specific judge of a specific district of a specific state. This recognition and resolution of named entities can be leveraged in a number of ways including providing hypertext links to information stored about a particular judge: their education, who appointed them, their other case opinions, etc. This paper discusses named entity recognition and resolution in legal documents such as US case law, depositions, and pleadings and other trial documents. The types of entities include judges, attorneys, companies, jurisdictions, and courts. We outline three methods for named entity recognition, lookup, context rules, and statistical models. We then describe an actual system for finding named entities in legal text and evaluate its accuracy. Similarly, for resolution, we discuss our blocking techniques, our resolution features, and the supervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniques we employ for the final matching. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Named entity recognition; Named entity resolution; Natural language processing","Actual system; Blocking technique; Case law; Database entry; Hypertext links; Legal documents; Lookups; Named entities; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; Proper nouns; Real-world entities; Semantic types; Semi-supervised; Specific state; Statistical models; Character recognition; Computational linguistics; Hypertext systems; Laws and legislation; Learning algorithms; Semantics; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,,,"Dozier, C., Haschart, R., Automatic extraction and linking of person names in legal text (2000) Proceedings of RIAO 2000, Recherche d'Information Assistee Par Ordinateur, pp. 1305-1321. , Paris, France, April 12-14; Dozier, C., Zielund, T., Cross document co-reference resolution applications for people in the legal domain (2004) Proceedings of the ACL 2004 Workshop on Reference Resolution and Its Applications, pp. 9-16. , Barcelona, Spain, July 25-26; Chaudhary, M., Dozier, C., Atkinson, G., Berosik, G., Guo, X., Samler, S., Mining legal text to create a litigation history database (2006) Proceedings of IASTED International Conference on Law and Technology, , Cambridge, MA, USA; Quaresma, P., Goņcalves, T., Using linguistic information and machine learning techniques to identify entities from juridical documents (2010) LNCS (LNAI), 6036, pp. 44-59. , Francesconi, E., Montemagni, S., Peters, W., Tiscornia, D.

Such workflows are most of the time described by a regulation stated in natural language and generally approved by the assemblies themselves. This document is subject to some interpretation, especially by the administration responsible of the day to day management. Currently this management is also on-going strong electronification with even a direct exposure of the parliamentary work on the internet for better transparency and control by the citizen. In this paper we report about our work of modelling the parliamentary workflows, starting from the official documents and in-place systems. The aim of this work is multiple: first, discover potential ambiguities and inconsistencies, then compare how similar are a number of parliaments and finally see how those models can be translated in the computer systems, especially in the perspective of the open-sourcing and mutualisation of such systems among different parliaments. Our practical experience of applying various modelling techniques is reported and discussed using two of the seven (!) parliaments running in Belgium.

To achieve this objective, in this paper we present a search engine which offers precise information to the public, allowing them to ask questions in the language with which they are most comfortable, without this affecting the quality of the service provided. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press.
