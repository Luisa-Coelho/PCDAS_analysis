Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction Using Ontology Class Hierarchy-Based Features	SEMANTIC WEB: ESWC 2014 SATELLITE EVENTS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	11th ESWC Conference	MAY 25-29, 2014	Anissaras, GREECE	Planet Data, FIRE, Forging Online Educ, Annomarket, LinkedUp, Linked Data Benchmark Council, LinkedTV, Preserving Linked Data, MediaMixer, Fluid Operat, VideoLectures NET, Yahoo Labs, XLike, xLiMe		Relation extraction; Distant supervision; Semantic web; Machine learning; Natural language processing		Relation extraction is a key step in the problem of structuring natural language text. This paper demonstrates a multi-class classifier for relation extraction, constructed using the distant supervision approach, along with resources of the Semantic Web. In particular, the classifier uses a feature based on the class hierarchy of an ontology that, in conjunction with basic lexical features, improves accuracy and recall. The paper contains extensive experiments, using a corpus extracted from the Wikipedia and the DBpedia ontology, to demonstrate the usefulness of the new feature.	[Assis, Pedro H.

DIZERES DISTOPICOS NA SOCIEDADE DA TRANSPARENCIA(1,2)	REVISTA MEDIACAO			English; Portuguese	Article						Society of Transparency; Discourse; Dystopia; Mediatic Scandal		In this article, we address the dystopias in statements about media scandals involving brands and government in the society of transparency. In order to accomplish this objective, we analyzed a corpus formed by media coverage about the company JBS, notably the discursive interactions in relation to the scandals resulting from the operation "Carne Fraca" - carried out by the Federal Police -, and the recording made by Joesley Batista with the former President Michel Temer, considering the meanings attributed to " transparency" and "trust", with a focus on discursive formations. The theoretical-methodological framework is composed of authors such as Han (2017), Peres-Neto (2014), Thompson (2002), as well as Baccega (2007), Orlandi (1999) and Maingueneau (1989), among others. The results show the permanence of political-economic dystopias in the media scandals of contemporary Brazil, in which different scandals at the present time or the ones in the recent past have recurrences that subtract the importance of values such as trust, sincerity and honesty.

However, visual explanations are not sufficient because different end-users have different backgrounds and preferences. Natural language explanations (NLEs) are inherently understandable by humans and, thus, can complement visual explanations. Therefore, we introduce a novel architecture based on multimodal Transformers to enable the generation of NLEs for image classification tasks. Contrary to the current literature, which models NLE generation as a supervised image captioning problem, we propose to learn to generate these textual explanations without their direct supervision, by starting from image captions and evolving to classification-relevant text. Preliminary experiments on a novel dataset where there is a clear demarcation between captions and NLEs show the potential of the approach and shed light on how it can be improved.

Some forensic tools help categorize files by type and allow automatization of tasks, like named entity recognition (NER). NER is a key component in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as relation extraction (RE) and information retrieval. The introduction of neural networks and transformer architectures in the last few years made it possible to develop more accurate models in different languages. This work proposes a reproducible setup to build a forensic pipeline for information extraction using NLP of texts. Our results show that it is possible to develop both NER and RE models in any language and tune its hyper-parameters to achieve state-of-art performance and build comprehensive knowledge graphs, decreasing the amount of time required for human supervision and review. We also find that solving this task in phases can further improve the performance, not only for digital investigation applications, but also for general-purpose information extraction and analysis.

The main goal of this task is to classify the polarity of a message. Even though many approaches have been proposed for sentiment analysis, some of the most successful ones rely on the availability of large annotated corpus, which is an expensive and time-consuming process. In recent years, distant supervision has been used to obtain larger datasets. So, inspired by these techniques, in this paper we extend such approaches to incorporate popular graphic symbols used in electronic messages, the emojis, in order to create a large sentiment corpus for Portuguese. Trained on almost one million tweets, several models were tested in both same domain and cross-domain corpora. Our methods obtained very competitive results in five annotated corpora from mixed domains (Twitter and product reviews), which proves the domain-independent property of such approach. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of emoticons and emojis is able to properly capture the sentiment of a message.

Consumers often lose faith in products, and the lack of Trust propagates to the companies behind them. This is even more so in mission-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles and clinical support systems. This paper follows grounded theory principles to elicit knowledge related to Trust, Ethics, and Transparency. We approach these qualities as Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), aiming to build catalogs to subsidize the construction of Socially Responsible Software. The corpus we have used was built on a selected collection of literature on Corporate Social Responsibility, with an emphasis on Business Ethics. Our challenge is how to encode the social perspective knowledge, mainly through the view of Corporate Social Responsibility, on how organizations or institutions achieve trustworthiness. Since our ground perspective is that of NFRs, results are presented by a catalogue of Trust as a Non-Functional Requirement, represented as a Softgoal Interdependency Graph (SIG). The SIG language helps software engineers in understanding alternatives they have to improve Trust in software products.

Nevertheless, this obligation has not been fully complied with by Brazilian public bodies. This scenario gave rise to a research aimed at investigating whether and how, currently, the websites of the Federal Executive Branch have complied with the principles of active transparency established by the legislation. In this sense, the problem that guided the investigation can be summarized in the following question: How have the websites of public agencies of the Brazilian Federal Executive Branch complied with the guidelines for active transparency established by LAI and Decree 7,724/2012? In order to answer the question, a documentary research was carried out, taking as a corpus the electronic documents published on some websites of these federal agencies, from January to December 2016. The content of the sites was compared with the guidelines established by the law. The obtained results expose significant noncompliance with the guidelines for active transparency, such as the lack of disclosure of skills, hours of public service, organizational structure, among other items. The conclusion suggests the necessity of improving the analyzed sites. Keywords: Governmental transparency. Law on access to public information. Federal Executive Power.

Currently in its 3rd cycle of implementation, EES privileges a focus on processes, specifically teaching processes. That justifies our intention to look intently into how processes oriented towards the improvement of teaching practices, such as teacher supervision, are conceptualized in the referentials that guide EES and on the evaluation reports it produces. The study was based on the documental analysis of the referentials of the 3 cycles of EES, of the school reports of the 3rd cycle of EES, and whenever possible, of the reports concerning the same schools in previous cycles of EES. The documental corpus was subjected to content analysis. The results highlight the presence of references to supervision since the 1st cycle of EES and a tendency, particularly in 3rd cycle reports, to value teacher supervision of a collaborative matrix, and to consider that practice is still not fully at schools.

These elected officials are commonly gathered in public assemblies, such as parliaments, where they discuss policies, legislate, and vote on fundamental initiatives. A core aspect of such democratic processes are the plenary debates, where important public discussions take place. Many parliaments around the world are increasingly keeping the transcripts of such debates and other parliamentary data in digital formats that are accessible to the public. This is meant to increase transparency and accountability, but these records are often only provided as raw text or even as images, with little, if any, annotation and in inconsistent formats, making them difficult to analyse. Here, we present PTARL-D, an annotated corpus of debates in the Portuguese Parliament, covering the years 1976 to 2019 and representing the entire period of Portuguese democracy.

Extracting microRNA-gene relations from biomedical literature using distant supervision	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSTTRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; SIMILARITY; DATABASE; NETWORK; KERNEL	Many biomedical relation extraction approaches are based on supervised machine learning, requiring an annotated corpus. Distant supervision aims at training a classifier by combining a knowledge base with a corpus, reducing the amount of manual effort necessary. This is particularly useful for biomedicine because many databases and ontologies have been made available for many biological processes, while the availability of annotated corpora is still limited. We studied the extraction of microRNA-gene relations from text. MicroRNA regulation is an important biological process due to its close association with human diseases. The proposed method, IBRel, is based on distantly supervised multi-instance learning. We evaluated IBRel on three datasets, and the results were compared with a co-occurrence approach as well as a supervised machine learning algorithm. While supervised learning outperformed on two of those datasets, IBRel obtained an F-score 28.3 percentage points higher on the dataset for which there was no training set developed specifically. To demonstrate the applicability of IBRel, we used it to extract 27 miRNA-gene relations from recently published papers about cystic fibrosis. Our results demonstrate that our method can be successfully used to extract relations from literature about a biological process without an annotated corpus.

Based on these observations, the present work discusses how the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods may harvest valuable knowledge about citizen-government communication in user profiling and satisfaction inference tasks. More specifically, from a large text dataset of this kind, we build a number of models using a range of supervised machine learning methods - including bidirectional long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), pre-trained context-sensitive embeddings (BERT) and others - and show that these outperform textual and non-textual baseline alternatives alike. This outcome makes a case in favour of NLP methods for these tasks, and paves the way for further applications in the public information access domain.

To achieve this objective, 1229 articles from the SPELL database were selected, which contained in the title, abstract or keyword, the expression "public administration" or "public management". After preliminary analysis, the articles were reduced to 911, which formed the corpus of the present study. The analysis was made using bibliometric techniques and content analysis. The most cited authors were identified, the locus and focus of the articles and the paradigm of each study. The consolidation of a Public Administration paradigm as a public interest has not been confirmed. The study contributes to the identification of the stage of maturity in which the studies in the area are, as well as its historical evolution and possible trends in the field.

Even when good results are achieved, the datasets used by the state-of-the-art approaches are rarely published. In order to address these problems, this work presents an automatic approach to build multilingual semantic relation detectors through distant supervision combining two of the largest resources of structured and unstructured content available on the Web, DBpedia and Wikipedia. We map the DBpedia ontology back to the Wikipedia text to extract more than 100.000 training instances for more than 90 DBpedia relations for English and Portuguese languages without human intervention. First, we mine the Wikipedia articles to find candidate instances for relations described in the DBpedia ontology. Second, we preprocess and normalize the data filtering out irrelevant instances. Finally, we use the normalized data to construct regularized logistic regression detectors that achieve more than 80% of F-Measure for both English and Portuguese languages. In this paper, we also compare the impact of different types of features on the accuracy of the trained detector, demonstrating significant performance improvements when combining lexical, syntactic and semantic features. Both the datasets and the code used in this research are available online.

Analysis of Fake News Classification for Insight into the Roles of Different Data Types	16TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SEMANTIC COMPUTING (ICSC 2022)	IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	16th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC)	JAN 26-28, 2022	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Explainability; Fake News; Natural Language Processing; Deep Learning		With the recent increase in online consumption of nontraditional news articles, dissemination is growing faster. Fake news takes advantage of such spread to cause mass misinformation and public mistrust. Due to the sheer amount of data in online media, automatic classification between real and fake articles is necessary. Unfortunately, most fake news stateof-the-art classifiers operate as a black-box with no explanation for their predictions. This work aims to use explainability methodologies to enable transparency into a state-of-the-art fake news classifier. We first apply Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) into a multi-modal deep neural network to interpret model decisions. Then, based on relevance scores, we apply an unique representation erasure process to learn which input features have greater effect on classification. Our analysis uncovers the preferred modalities for classification, and finds common themes across fake news articles. Furthermore, as a result of our observations and model improvements, we report a higher F1score than earlier works.	[Ferreira, Victor C.; Franca, Felipe M.

We compared Binary Bag of Words, Bag of Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Word2vec and Doc2vec models in different dimensions and with different hyperparameters, totaling 45 models. Our experiment consists in evaluating the result of clustering done by K-Means algorithm over the vectors created by each model. The evaluation was done both quantitatively, using clustering evaluation metrics, and qualitatively, considering relevant aspects for the application of this type of algorithm in the legal environment, such as transparency and interpretability. Our experiments were conducted in a database of 30,000 documents in Brazilian Portuguese of judicial moves of the Tribunal de Justica do Rio Grande do Norte (TJRN). The research results suggest that the TF-IDF method seems to be the most suitable for the task, outperforming the other models in considered metrics. The other methods appear to perform equally well, with the exception of Doc2vec, which performed poorly.

Our framework efficiently incorporates indirect supervision via constraints on posterior distributions of probabilistic models with latent variables. Posterior regularization separates model complexity from the complexity of structural constraints it is desired to satisfy. By directly imposing decomposable regularization on the posterior moments of latent variables during learning, we retain the computational efficiency of the unconstrained model while ensuring desired constraints hold in expectation. We present an efficient algorithm for learning with posterior regularization and illustrate its versatility on a diverse set of structural constraints such as bijectivity, symmetry and group sparsity in several large scale experiments, including multi-view learning, cross-lingual dependency grammar induction, unsupervised part-of-speech induction, and bitext word alignment.(1)	[Ganchev, Kuzman; Gillenwater, Jennifer; Taskar, Ben] Univ Penn, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Graca, Joao] L2F Inesc ID Spoken Language Syst Lab, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal	University of Pennsylvania; INESC-ID; Universidade de Lisboa	Ganchev, K (autor correspondente), Univ Penn, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Levine 302,3330 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.

KBs can sometimes also provide additional information to the RE task. One of the methods that adopt this strategy is the RESIDE model, which proposes a distantly-supervised neural relation extraction using side information from KBs. Considering that this method outperformed state-of-the-art baselines, in this paper, we propose a related approach to RESIDE also using additional side information, but simplifying the sentence encoding with BERT embeddings. Through experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method in Google Distant Supervision and Riedel datasets concerning the BGWA and RESIDE baseline methods. Although Area Under the Curve is decreased because of unbalanced datasets, P@N results have shown that the use of BERT as sentence encoding allows superior performance to baseline methods.

The combination of transparency and digital information has given rise to the concept of Open Government, that increases citizen understanding and monitoring of government actions, which in turn improves the quality of public services and of the government decision making process. With the goal of improving legislative transparency and the understanding of the Brazilian regulatory process and its characteristics, this paper introduces RegBR, the first national framework to centralize, classify and analyze regulations from the Brazilian government. A centralized database of Brazilian federal legislation built from automated ETL routines and processed with data mining and machine learning techniques was created. Our framework evaluates different NLP models in a text classification task on our novel Portuguese legal corpus and performs regulatory analysis based on metrics that concern linguistic complexity, restrictiveness, law interest, and industry-specific citation relevance. Our results were examined over time and validated by correlating them with known episodes of regulatory changes in Brazilian history, such as the implementation of new economic plans or the emergence of an energy crisis. Methods and metrics proposed by this framework can be used by policy makers to measure their own work and serve as inputs for future studies that could analyze government changes and their relationship with federal regulations.

However, it still suffers from limited number and size of speech corpora for specific domains, such as the assessment of children's personality. This paper investigates a semi-supervised training approach to tackle this scenario. We devise an experimental setup with age and language mismatch and two training sets: a small labeled training set from the lntcrspcech 2012 Personality Sub-challenge, containing French adult speech labeled with personality OCEAN traits, and a large unlabeled training set of Portuguese children's speech. As test set, a corpus of Portuguese children's speech labeled with OCEAN traits is used. Based on this setting. we investigate a weak supervision approach that iteratively refines an initial model trained with the labeled data-set using the unlabeled data-set. We also investigate knowledge-based features, which leverage expert knowledge in acoustic-prosodic cues and thus need no extra data. Results show that, despite the large mismatch imposed by language and age differences, it is possible to attain improvements with these techniques, pointing both to the benefits of using a weak supervision and expert-based acoustic-prosodic features across age and language.

To this end, we deface standard faciality into fragments of becomings, pieces of imperceptible multiplicities, latent forces of an everyday that wants movement and, paradoxically, resists it. The method is an installation, where images alternate with philosophical and literary passages, making up a mosaic of intelligibility that mixes fiction and non-fiction. With regard to images, we make use of two main editing resources: transparency and overlay, which dialogue directly with the objective of undoing standard faciality with the subtleness and force of becomings. The corpus of study unfolds into three parts: becoming landing-between, becoming-flames, and, finally, becoming-tides.

Recent Transformer-based Language Models have proven capable of producing contextual word representations that reliably convey sense-specific information, simply as a product of self supervision. Prior work has shown that these contextual representations can be used to accurately represent large sense inventories as sense embeddings, to the extent that a distance-based solution to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks outperforms models trained specifically for the task. Still, there remains much to understand on how to use these Neural Language Models (NLMs) to produce sense embeddings that can better harness each NLM's meaning representation abilities. In this work we introduce a more principled approach to leverage information from all layers of NLMs, informed by a probing analysis on 14 NLM variants. We also emphasize the versatility of these sense embeddings in contrast to task-specific models, applying them on several sense-related tasks, besides WSD, while demonstrating improved performance using our proposed approach over prior work focused on sense embeddings. Finally, we discuss unexpected findings regarding layer and model performance variations, and potential applications for downstream tasks.& nbsp;(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As a complex system, agribusiness presents many possibilities to take advantage of blockchain technology. The main goal of this paper is to identify the purposes for which blockchain has been applied in the agribusiness sector, for which a PRISMA-based systematic review was carried out. The scientific literature corpus was accessed and selected from Elsevier's Scopus and ISI of Knowledge's Web of Science (WoS) platforms, using the PRISMA protocol procedures. Seventy-one articles were selected for analysis. Blockchain application in agribusiness is a novel topic, with the first publication dating from 2016. The technological development prevails more than blockchain applications since it has been addressed mainly in the Computer Sciences and Engineering. Blockchain applications for agribusiness management of financial, energy, logistical, environmental, agricultural, livestock, and industrial purposes have been reported in the literature. The findings suggest that blockchain brings many benefits when used in agribusiness supply chains. We concluded that the research on blockchain applications in agribusiness is only at an early stage, as many prototypes are being developed and tested in the laboratory. In the near future, blockchain will be increasingly applied across all economic sectors, including agribusiness, promoting greater reliability and agility in information with a reduced cost. Several gaps for future studies were observed, with significant value for science, industry, and society.

The corpus is composed by articles published in Brazilian high impact journals in the field of Public Administration, public policies and information systems, from 2002 until 2016. The study analyzes the texts according to variables year, journal, author, approach (managerial, political, hybrid), through content analysis. The research has found 49 articles mostly concentrated in only seven journals and mostly produced by researchers from only six Brazilian institutions. In addition, we found that the term "digital democracy" was practically non-existent until 2011. Finally, management approach was predominant in early stages, but was overcome by political approach in recent years. We conclude that the area of Administration has been able to overcome an overly managerial view, but the subject still needs more academic attention.

In this work, we propose employing self-supervised methods. To that end, we trained with three self-supervised algorithms on a large corpus of unlabeled dental images, which contained 38K bitewing radiographs (BWRs). We then applied the learned neural network representations on tooth-level dental caries classification, for which we utilized labels extracted from electronic health records (EHRs). Finally, a holdout test-set was established, which consisted of 343 BWRs and was annotated by three dental professionals and approved by a senior dentist. This test-set was used to evaluate the fine-tuned caries classification models. Our experimental results demonstrate the obtained gains by pretraining models using self-supervised algorithms. These include improved caries classification performance (6 p.p. increase in sensitivity) and, most importantly, improved label-efficiency. In other words, the resulting models can be fine-tuned using few labels (annotations). Our results show that using as few as 18 annotations can produce >= 45% sensitivity, which is comparable to human-level diagnostic performance. This study shows that self-supervision can provide gains in medical image analysis, particularly when obtaining labels is costly and expensive.

This issue becomes even more evident when considering the Brazilian Law of Information Access (LAI), which, among other purposes, regulates the fundamental right of information access, which is constitutionally present. As main goal, the present article sought to relate the text of said law and the moral aspects found in the literature of the area of Ethics in Organization of Knowledge. Methodologically, the LAI integral text and a corpus of thirteen articles that worked with the ethical dimension in the studies on Knowledge Organization were comparatively analyzed, in order to identify the moral aspects found in this normative and bibliographic group. In conclusion, it is possible to identify a link between the analyzed scientific literature and normative prediction in Brazil, so that information Access as a moral supravalue that aims at equanimity and quality access to knowledge produced by society, and the normative about such access in terms of transparency in a democratic society dialogue in a consonant manner.

However, the widespread use of these technologies ended up building a relationship of dependence that can disrupt the doctor-patient relationship. In this context, digital scribes are automated clinical documentation systems that capture the physician-patient conversation and then generate the documentation for the appointment, enabling the physician to engage with the patient entirely. We have performed a systematic literature review on intelligent solutions for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with automatic documentation during a medical interview. The scope included only original research on systems that could detect speech and transcribe it in a natural and structured fashion simultaneously with the doctor-patient interaction, excluding speech-to-text-only technologies. The search resulted in a total of 1995 titles, with eight articles remaining after filtering for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The intelligent models mainly consisted of an ASR system with natural language processing capability, a medical lexicon, and structured text output. None of the articles had a commercially available product at the time of the publication and reported limited real-life experience. So far, none of the applications has been prospectively validated and tested in large-scale clinical studies. Nonetheless, these first reports suggest that automatic speech recognition may be a valuable tool in the future to facilitate medical registration in a faster and more reliable manner. Improving transparency, accuracy, and empathy could drastically change how patients and doctors experience a medical visit. Unfortunately, clinical data on the usability and benefits of such applications is almost non-existent. We believe that future work in this area is necessary and needed.

However, most wordnets are handcrafted by experts, which limits their growth. In this article, we propose an automatic approach to create wordnets by exploiting textual resources, dubbed ECO. After extracting semantic relation instances, identified by discriminating textual patterns, ECO discovers synonymy clusters, used as synsets, and attaches the remaining relations to suitable synsets. Besides introducing each step of ECO, we report on how it was implemented to create Onto.PT, a public lexical ontology for Portuguese. Onto.PT is the result of the automatic exploitation of Portuguese dictionaries and thesauri, and it aims to minimise the main limitations of existing Portuguese lexical knowledge bases.

Thus, this study aims to analyze the extent to which the Government Schools investigated potential guidelines for entrepreneurship education in the public sector. Method: An empirical qualitative-exploratory study was carried out, involving the multiple case study method, with three renowned Brazilian Government Schools of the executive branch at the three federative levels as the locus. In-depth interviews, guided by script, recorded, and transcribed, were carried out with the strategic representatives of these institutions, generating a corpus of textual analysis treated by the IRAMUTEQ software with the appropriate content analysis. Results: Developing entrepreneurship education guidelines in the public sector based on context constructs (macro, meso and micro); in the profile of the civil servant (student); entrepreneurial education; in the legal and regulatory framework; the adequacy of the infrastructure and the competence of the facilitator (teacher). Originality / Relevance: Analogously to a mix of educational planning instruments, there is a possibility to systematize educative training actions there are capable of favoring specific entrepreneurial andragogy for public employees. Theoretical / Methodological Contributions: Importance of demystifying the theme of entrepreneurship in the public sector, as well as observance of the role of Government Schools in the staff of modern and effective public management. Social / Managerial Contributions: Greater guarantees for generating public value through intrapreneurship that would resignify the intra-organizational processes of government bodies.

J	Massuchin, MG; Silva, LF				Massuchin, Michele Goulart; Silva, Luana Fonseca			Permanent campaign on digital social networks: a case study analysis of Flavio Dino's fanpage, in Brasil	REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE RELACIONES PUBLICAS			Spanish	Article						permanent campaign; social digital networks; political communication		This research analyzes the fanpage of the governor of the State of Maranho, Flavio Dino (PC do B), on Facebook, considered as one of the most active politicians in social networks in Brazil. The article assumes that although the official campaign has a special time, outside the election period, political actors - especially the elected - can use internet tools to gain public visibility. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to verify how the governor uses his fanpage throughout the term. The text brings a discussion based on the concept of permanent campaign as a way to link with the public and the importance of this space for public and governmental communication, especially because the positives characteristics of social networks and the type of information that can be shared with the citizens. The article discusses how communication between representatives and representatives can go beyond visibility, offering content about transparency, accountability, closeness to followers and discussion of topics of public interest. For the analysis are observed characteristics about the content - appeal, strategies and themes - as well as the formats of each post. The corpus of empirical research consists of 359 posts, which corresponds to the total of publications made during the months of January, February and March (2018). The methodology used is the content analysis. The data collection was performed by one of the authors of the article, from a codebook produced for this research, based on the literature. Among the results, we can see the use of the strategic tool, especially for accountability of de government. On the other hand, it has also been noted that there is less information about the inside actions of the government, which would indicate transparency. Another result shows the public agenda of the governor together with a thematic and pragmatic discourse, which indicates that there is a mixture between the visibility to the government and the presentation of thematic contents, about education, economy and infrastructure, for example. In addition, programmatic discourse is more frequent than emotional and political discourse. Thus, if on the one hand there are characteristics of political marketing and professionalization, to give visibility and show actions of the government, on the other we perceive elements that dialogue with the concept of public communication, as the focus on the thematization and the dialogue with the followers, which shows an important role of the social network in the distribution of information of public interest, even being a space of the governor and not of the institutions.

Methods: Thirty-six patients with refractory drop attacks had selective posterior callosotomy and prospective follow-up for >4 years. Falls, episodes of aggressive behavior, and IQ were quantified. Autonomy in activities of daily living, axial tonus, and speech generated a functional score ranging from 0 to 13. Subjective effect on patient well-being and caregiver burden was also assessed. Results: Median monthly frequency of drop attacks decreased from 150 to 0.5. Thirty patients (83%) achieved either complete or >90% control of the falls. Need for constant supervision decreased from 90% to 36% of patients. All had estimated IQ below 85. Median functional score increased from 7 to 10 (p = 0.03). No patient had decrease in speech fluency or hemiparesis. Caregivers rated the effect of the procedure as excellent in 40% and as having greatly improved functioning in another 50%. Clinical, EEG, imaging, and cognitive variables did not correlate with outcome. Conclusions: This cohort study with objective outcome assessment suggests that selective posterior callosotomy is safe and effective to control drop attacks, with functional and behavioral gains in patients with intellectual disability. Results are comparable to historical series of total callosotomy and suggest that anterior callosal fibers may be spared. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that selective posterior callosotomy reduces falls in patients with epileptic drop attacks.

J	Pires, LA				Pires, Leonardo Aboim			The intellectual scales of environment: Agricultural pests and public sphere in 19th century Portugal	HISTORIA AGRARIA			English	Article						biological invasions; agriculture; newspapers; Portugal	WINE	Studies and research on biological invasions have acquired increasing attention in environmental history. However, the acknowledgement of certain specific cultural markers -such as the press- has been hitherto limited in such works. In light of this, this paper seeks to evaluate the importance of regional Portuguese newspapers in studying plant pests and agricultural diseases through a substantial corpus of publications produced between the 1850s and 1910s.This article looks at three newspapers Jornal de Penafiel (1890-1914), the Damiao de Goes (1886-1914) and the O Elvense (1880-1904) in order to establish the informative potential gleaned from these types of sources in different regions in the north, centre and south Portugal respectively. The results highlight the importance of vine diseases (phylloxera, mildium, oidium) in the examined journalistic narratives. Nevertheless, other pests (potato blight, chestnut blight, brown rot) or bioinvaders (locust) were also important parts of these discourses.The results of this research reveals just how closely directed periodical press and diffusion of technical knowledge were in the strategies and attitudes against agricultural pests, showing that science was incorporated into the relationship between State and the rural communities.

The corpus of the analysis brings together 683 publications made in 2019, a period in which the page showed an increase in audience compared to the previous year (2018). The quantitative research, though with a qualitative look, identified posts that made political knowledge possible to the citizen, as well as interviews to understand the use of the social network by the institution. An appropriate analysis to understand the use of the network by the public body, since the latest survey by DataSenado shows that 74% of Brazilians have or have had a social network - Facebook, Whatsapp, lnstagram, or Twitter. A significant number, especially when compared to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), from 2019, indicates that two-thirds of the country's population (69.8%) have an internet connection. These numbers drive the research of communicologists and political scientists, who seek to understand how this communication network is being part of people's daily lives. Mainly taking into account that the internet, and especially social networks, are becoming a space where different people connect, share content and participate in the political debate a few clicks away. The internet's expansion in Brazil and the number of people connected to networks made different public bodies create profiles on social networks to interact with people. A new channel that aims to establish a rapprochement with this digital audience, ensure transparency in management and encourage the participation of everyone in the decision-making process. As occurred at the City Council of Itapevi (CMI, in Portuguese). However, to guarantee a minimum of success in this digital endeavor, the information available on the networks must be of public interest and its content must be accessible, allowing citizens to understand how public authorities work and to know the process of choosing representatives. A knowledge that can be shared with the citizen through political literacy, as highlighted by Cosson (2016: 51): "these are knowledge related to the functioning of the State, with an emphasis on democratic mechanisms, which involves, on one hand, a knowledge about elections, parties and institutions, and on the other hand, the rights and duties of the citizen". Therefore, the article was divided into four parts, in addition to the final considerations. The first seeks to clarify the difference between public and political communication; the second addresses how Facebook has supported CMI's communication strategy. Furthermore, there is a literature review on political literacy. Finally, the objective of this study: an analysis of the possibility of political literacy through publications made on the CMI profile on Facebook, in 2019, which concludes that the page is a virtual space for debate and public expression in the city, with growth potential for the promotion of citizenship and political knowledge. The study is based on publications in the areas of public communication (Matos, 2000; Marques, 2011; Correia, Ferreira y Santo, 2010), social networks (Recuero, 2010; Ferrari, 2010, Silva, 2017), and political literacy (Cosson, 2020; Biesta, Lawly e Kelly 2009).

Gonadotrophic, prolactin, corticosterone, and gonadal hormones levels over 15 months in Giant Amazon River Turtles - Podocnemis expansa (Schweigger, 1812) (Testudines: Podocnemididae), in captive conditions	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY			English	Article						Podocnemis expansa; LH; FSH; progesterone; testosterone; 17 beta-estradiol; corticosterone; prolactin; seasonality; reproduction	CHRYSEMYS-PICTA; CHELYDRA-SERPENTINA; PLASMA-CORTICOSTERONE; UNIFILIS TROSCHEL; SNAPPING TURTLE; SEASONAL CYCLES; OVARIAN GROWTH; CORPUS-LUTEUM; PROGESTERONE; VITELLOGENESIS	In order to achieve successful captive breeding the Podocnemis expansa, it is necessary to study their reproductive endocrinology. The purpose of this research was to evaluate and characterize plasma concentrations in gonadotrophic, gonadic, corticosterone and prolactin hormones from Giant Amazon Turtles under captive conditions. Blood samples were collected over a 15 month period. The samples were assayed by the use of radioimmunoassay, prolactin, corticosterone, LH, FSH, testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone. We verified significant seasonal pattern increase in 17 beta-estradiol levels and decrease in progesterone levels in the course of a year, which indicates vitellogenesis. This is related to normal ovarian cycles and possibly to the functional integrity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis of captive females. There were negative correlations between testosterone and corticosterone in the male samples, suggestive of stress (management stress) on the reproductive system. The plasma concentrations of gonadotrophic, gonadic, prolactin and corticosterone hormones may be used as a reference for further research and possible therapeutic approaches. The data collected during this research are unprecedented for this species and may serve as a reference for future research regarding the reproductive cycle of this turtle, also allowing reproductive management while in captivity. Information about these hormones must be gathered from wild populations during different periods of the year for better clarification of the reproductive physiology of this species.	[Freneau, G.
