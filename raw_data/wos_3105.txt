AB In this paper, we develop a Vietnamese Question Answering system to answer simple questions about provisions, processes, procedures, and sanctions in law on enterprises Vietnam. Research to build a Vietnamese Question Answering system is more difficult than English Question Answering system because of lack of Vietnamese processing resources and tools, or their results isn't high. We have utilized available Vietnamese resources, tools and modified some tools (such as Lucene) and algorithms, which worked well in English, applies in Vietnamese. From that, we have proposed a similarity-based model to build a Vietnamese Question Answering system in Vietnam's legal documents, namely vLawyer system. In experimental section, we achieved promising result, about 70% precision in legal documents, it proved that our approach is reasonable in legal document domain.

DE Legal document; Text classification; Text segmentation
AB In order to justify rulings, legal documents need to present facts as well as an analysis built thereon. In this paper, we present two methods to automatically extract case-relevant facts from French-language legal documents pertaining to tenant-landlord disputes. Our models consist of an ensemble that classifies a given sentence as either Fact or non-Fact, regardless of its context, and a recurrent architecture that contextually determines the class of each sentence in a given document. Both models are combined with a heuristic-based segmentation system that identifies the optimal point in the legal text where the presentation of facts ends and the analysis begins. When tested on a dataset of rulings from the Regie du Logement of the city of ANONYMOUS, the recurrent architecture achieves a better performance than the sentence ensemble classifier. The fact segmentation task produces a splitting index which can be weighted in order to favour shorter segments with few instances of non-facts or longer segments that favour the recall of facts. Our best configuration successfully segments 40% of the dataset within a single sentence of offset with respect to the gold standard. An analysis of the results leads us to believe that the commonly accepted assumption that, in legal documents, facts should precede the analysis is often not followed.

AB We present a proof of concept for using automated text analytic techniques to extract key information from lengthy B2B legal documents using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a machine learning-based natural language-processing framework. Our methodological contributions overcome the text length limitations of applying BERT to long legal documents. We identify franchise disclosure documents (FDDs) as an initial use case for these methodologies and a fruitful avenue for further exploration. From FDDs, we successfully extract answers to questions about firm structure, contractual obligations, finances, and litigation disclosures while also overcoming the technical challenges of applying BERT to large bodies of text. Questionand-answer techniques such as these, deployed in a B2B context, potentially can increase transparency and clarity for prospective exchange partners, addressing concerns in the literature about legal document readability and associated problems of information asymmetry and disclosure misunderstanding. Our discussion identifies promising contexts and an agenda for future scholarship focused on question-and-answer in B2B research.

ID RESOLUTION
AB Legal and regulatory texts are ubiquitous and important in our life. Automated processing of such documents using natural language processing and information retrieval techniques is desired. Many legal text processing problems require information extraction as a base component. In this paper, we address the task of extracting references from law and regulatory documents, which are necessary for recognition of the relations between documents and document parts, and other problems. We formulate the task as a sequence labeling problem and introduce several extraction models, consisting of both traditional (conditional random fields) and more advanced (deep neural networks) methods. In addition to features learned by deep networks, we investigate various types of manually engineered features that reflect the characteristics of legal documents. Our best model that combines bidirectional long short-term memory networks and conditional random fields achieves 95.35% in the F-1 score on a corpus consisting of more than 11 thousand sentences from Vietnamese law and regulatory documents.

AB This work describes a Shallow Question Answering System (QAS) restricted to legal documents. This system returns a set of relevant articles extracted from several regulation documents. The set of relevant articles allows inferring answers to questions posed in natural language. We take the approach of representing the set of all the articles as a graph: the question is split in two parts (called A and B), and each of them is added as part of the graph. Then several paths are constructed from part A of the question to pail B, so that the shortest path contains the relevant articles to the question. We evaluate our method comparing the answers given by a traditional information retrieval system-vector space model adjusted for article retrieval, instead of document retrieval-and the answers to 21 questions given manually by the general lawyer of the National Polytechnic Institute, based on 26 different regulations (academy regulation, scholarships regulation, postgraduate studies regulation, etc.); with the answer of our system based on the same set of regulations. The results show that our system performs twice as better with regard to the traditional Information Retrieval model for Question Answering.

AB This article aims to evaluate the impact of different textual feature extraction methods in the task of clustering Brazilian legal texts. We compared Binary Bag of Words, Bag of Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Word2vec and Doc2vec models in different dimensions and with different hyperparameters, totaling 45 models. Our experiment consists in evaluating the result of clustering done by K-Means algorithm over the vectors created by each model. The evaluation was done both quantitatively, using clustering evaluation metrics, and qualitatively, considering relevant aspects for the application of this type of algorithm in the legal environment, such as transparency and interpretability. Our experiments were conducted in a database of 30,000 documents in Brazilian Portuguese of judicial moves of the Tribunal de Justica do Rio Grande do Norte (TJRN). The research results suggest that the TF-IDF method seems to be the most suitable for the task, outperforming the other models in considered metrics. The other methods appear to perform equally well, with the exception of Doc2vec, which performed poorly.

AB Previous work has shown that modeling relationships between articles of a regulation as vertices of a graph network works twice as better than traditional information retrieval systems for returning articles relevant to the question. In this work we experiment by using natural language techniques such as lemmatizing and using manual and automatic thesauri for improving question based document retrieval. For the construction of the graph, we follow the approach of representing the set of all the articles as a graph; the question is split in two parts, and each of them is added as part of the graph. Then several paths are constructed from part A of the question to part 13, so that the shortest path contains the relevant articles to the question. We evaluate our method comparing the answers given by a traditional information retrieval system-vector space model adjusted for article retrieval. instead of document retrieval-and the answers to 21 questions given manually by the general lawyer of the National Polytechnic Institute. based on 25 different regulations (academy regulation, scholarships regulation, postgraduate studies regulation, etc.); with the answer of our system based on the same set of regulations. We found that lemmatizing increases performance in around 10%, while the use of thesaurus has a low impact.

AB Text mining techniques have been widely used to process large volumes of documents. However, there is still a large gap when defining the architecture for systems with transactional elements of computational intelligence. The aim of the paper is to outline a proposed architecture to build a computational system that uses text mining techniques to index content from the database of the Official Gazette in the city of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim in the state of Espirito Santo, transforming the information previously available in natural language into a structured format that can be persisted. To validate the architecture we developed a prototype in Java accessible in the Web environment to evaluate the tool. To evaluate the tool, a case study featured a database composed of 22 documents, containing 198 normative acts from the database of the Official Gazette, in which good levels of accuracy and coverage of information retrieval were identified. This study contributes to the presentation of a hybrid architecture consisting of components of the model of transactional systems and elements of text mining, in addition to the use of software design patterns.

AB Public information access services are provided by dozens of countries around the world as a means to promote transparency and democracy, and present a number of research opportunities for the development of computational models that help understand both users and their needs. Based on these observations, the present work discusses how the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods may harvest valuable knowledge about citizen-government communication in user profiling and satisfaction inference tasks. More specifically, from a large text dataset of this kind, we build a number of models using a range of supervised machine learning methods - including bidirectional long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), pre-trained context-sensitive embeddings (BERT) and others - and show that these outperform textual and non-textual baseline alternatives alike. This outcome makes a case in favour of NLP methods for these tasks, and paves the way for further applications in the public information access domain.

AB We detail the challenges and barriers in applying natural language processing techniques to a collection of medical examiner case investigation notes related to fatal opioid poisonings. Major advances in biomedical informatics have made natural language processing (NLP) of medical texts both a realistic and useful task. Biomedical NLP tools are typically designed to process documents originating from biomedical libraries or electronic health records (EHRs). The usefulness of biomedical NLP tools on texts authored outside of EHRs is unclear, despite an abundance of medicolegal documents existing at the intersection of medicine and law. In particular, we detail our experiences processing unstructured text and extracting semantic concepts using case investigation notes; these notes were authored by trained investigative professionals working in a medical examiner's office and describe cases containing deaths related to fatal opioid poisonings. Applying NLP to case notes is a particularly important step in generalizing the advances of biomedical NLP for other related domains and giving guidance to data scientists working with unstructured data generated outside of EHRs.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper provides an overview of machine learning models, as compared to traditional economic models. It also lays out emerging issues in law and economics that the machine learning methodology raises. In doing so, Asian contexts are considered. Law and economics scholarship has applied econometric models for statistical inferences, but law as social engineering often requires forward-looking predictions rather than retrospective inferences. Machine learning can be used as an alternative or supplementary tool to improve the accuracy of legal prediction by controlling out-of-sample variance along with in-sample bias and by fitting diverse models to data with non-linear or otherwise complex distribution. In the legal arena, the past experience of using economic models in antitrust and other high-stakes litigation provides a clue as to how to introduce artificial intelligence into the legal decision-making process. Law and economics is also expected to provide useful insights as to how to balance the development of the artificial intelligence technology with fundamental social values such as human rights and autonomy.

AB Tools such as web search engines are Currently focused on the exhaustive recovery of information. These tools, although very useful in certain contexts, do not respond to the needs of public information services, which aim to be precise, dealing with requests from the public without overloading them with irrelevant information. Just as when a member of the public telephones his city's helpline he wants a single response to his question, a web tool which tries to emulate this service also needs to be precise, ideally providing only one response. To achieve this objective, in this paper we present a search engine which offers precise information to the public, allowing them to ask questions in the language with which they are most comfortable, without (his affecting the quality of the service provided.

ID CONSTRUCTION
AB The knowledge graph was first used in the information search of the Internet as a way to improve the quality of the search because it contains a huge amount of structured knowledge data. In this paper, the knowledge map algorithm is studied through natural language processing technology and probabilistic fuzzy information aggregation, and the knowledge map completion algorithm is cognitive-fitted. NLP is natural language processing. Based on the experiments in this paper, it can be seen that, after combining the algorithm, the behavior data set of 1000 Amazon users was analyzed, and it can be found that the accuracy of the algorithm improves as the proportion of data in the experiment increases. Among them, the 10% dataset has a correct rate of 0.66; the 30% dataset has a final accuracy rate of 0.68; and the 50% dataset has a final accuracy rate of 0.70. The experimental results of this paper show that using probabilistic fuzzy information aggregation and natural language processing technology as a way to complete the knowledge graph can improve the accuracy of the operation. It plays an important role in the development of intelligent cognition and search engines.

ID SENTIMENT
AB Emotion analysis has been attracting researchers' attention. Most previous works in the artificial-intelligence field focus on recognizing emotion rather than mining the reason why emotions are not or wrongly recognized. The correlation among emotions contributes to the failure of emotion recognition. In this article, we try to fill the gap between emotion recognition and emotion correlation mining through natural language text from Web news. The correlation among emotions, expressed as the confusion and evolution of emotion, is primarily caused by human emotion cognitive bias. To mine emotion correlation from emotion recognition through text, three kinds of features and two deep neural-network models are presented. The emotion confusion law is extracted through an orthogonal basis. The emotion evolution law is evaluated from three perspectives: one-step shift, limited-step shifts, and shortest path transfer. The method is validated using three datasets: 1) the titles; 2) the bodies; and 3) the comments of news articles, covering both objective and subjective texts in varying lengths (long and short). The experimental results show that in subjective comments, emotions are easily mistaken as anger. Comments tend to arouse emotion circulations of love-anger and sadness-anger. In objective news, it is easy to recognize text emotion as love and cause fear-joy circulation. These findings could provide insights for applications regarding affective interaction, such as network public sentiment, social media communication, and human-computer interaction.

ID BELIEFS
AB This article investigates how the emergence of broadband Internet connectivity as an essential utility has influenced the development of public policies that aim to promote universal access to basic communications services in Canada. We utilize quantitative Natural Language Processing (NLP)/content analysis techniques to map the evolution of conceptual emphasis by stakeholders in their formal submissions to the telecom regulator along a series of public proceedings between 2009 and 2016. The analysis documents that the growing essentiality of broadband Internet access as an enabler of social and economic activities made its quality and affordability questions with broad economic and policy relevance that cross the traditional conceptualization of universal access in terms of the rural-urban digital divide. The case study offers a novel explanation for reliance on formal public consultation processes in administrative law in terms of policy innovation: Opening communication channels with the public can be valuable for enabling policymakers legitimize regulatory adjustments necessitated by technological change.

DE Zipf's law; Human-machine dialog; Dialog Systems; Agent development
ID NATURAL-LANGUAGE; FREQUENCY
AB Zipf's law is a mathematically relatively simple formula stating that the frequency of a word is inversely correlated with its rank. Zipf's law is well-known in computational linguistics and cognitive sciences alike. In the context of agent development, however, Zipf's law has hardly ever been mentioned. This is surprising as principles regarding language likely benefit the development of conversational agents. This paper serves as a starting point to explore the role of Zipf's law in agent development, showing that Zipf's law also applies to dialog. Moreover, it can shed light on human-machine dialog. In addition to word frequency distributions that demonstrate Zipf's law, we also included frequency distributions of words at specific positions in the sentence as well as turn lengths. Zipf's law was found in the far majority of analyses we conducted. In addition, we investigated whether Zipf's law can be used to detect differences between human and agent-generated speech through correlating the distributions and found that even though both the human and agent frequency distributions follow Zipf's law, these distributions are not necessarily similar, shedding light on where agent dialog may distinguish itself from human dialog. The findings in this paper can thus serve as a way to monitor to what extent ubiquitous patterns in human-human dialog are found in human-machine dialog.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB The development of artificial intelligence is promising and there are more and more applications and programmes which, based on said AI, offer efficient solutions for carrying out all kinds of tasks. Public administration, with the final objective of contributing to appropriate consolidation of an intelligent administration which can continue to be efficient, personalised, electronic and a guarantee of citizenship rights, is progressively incorporating this technology in public services. These intelligent tools have a great capacity for improving the provision of public services, to the extent that they can process natural language or analyse high quantities of data in order to help in making public decisions, among other functions. This new administration, together with this potential of great improvements in administrative activity, is accompanied at the same time by a series of risks with a clear legal and ethical dimension. As a result, the required technological progress for the improvement of public services can come into conflict with legal security, with basic rights such as equality at the present time, privacy or the protection of personal data, or with the principles or obligations of administrative conduct; for example, the obligation of motivation, transparency or the efficiency of defence or appeal law, as it will not always be possible to know the reason for the results given by some forms of artificial intelligence. Among other regulatory challenges that need to be addressed from the point of view of administrative law, it is possible to highlight in its principal aims the range of transparency (algorithmical), the suitable motivation for decisions assisted by artificial intelligences, and responsibility in the event of damages occasioned by following or by not being aware of the results provided by algorism.

ID IMPACT
AB Rationale: Detecting users at risk of suicide in text-based counseling services is essential to ensure that at-risk individuals are flagged and prioritized. Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a domain knowledge-aware risk assessment (KARA) model to improve our ability of suicide detection in online counseling systems. Methods: We obtained the largest known de-identified dataset from an emotional support system established in Hong Kong, comprising 5682 Cantonese conversations between help-seekers and counselors. Of those, 682 conversations disclosed crisis intentions of suicide. We constructed a suicide-knowledge graph, representing suicide-related domain knowledge as a computer-processible graph. Such knowledge graph was embedded into a deep learning model to improve its ability to identify help-seekers in crisis. As the baseline, a standard NLP model was applied to the same task. 80% of the study samples were randomly sampled to train model parameters. The remaining 20% were used for model validation. Evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and c-statistic were reported. Results: Both KARA and the baseline achieved high precision (0.984 and 0.951, shown in Table 2) and high recall (0.942 and 0.947) towards non-crisis cases. For crisis cases, however, KARA model achieved a much higher recall than the baseline (0.870 vs 0.791). The c-statistics of KARA and the baseline were 0.815 and 0.760, respectively. Conclusion: KARA significantly outperformed standard NLP models, demonstrating good translational value and clinical relevance.

AB Social media adoption by public administrations is usually related to the promotion of transparency, participation and collaboration. However, less attention has been paid to the utilisation of social media for public service delivery. Hence, this paper explores what strategies of use local governments are employing to create content on social media. To do so, our study re-elaborates a well-known interpretative framework of social media interactions in the public sector, regarding three categories: providing information, citizen interaction and public service delivery. By analysing Twitter data through machine-learning automated natural language processing, we test the framework studying posted content from a leading group of European city councils. Our conclusions confirm the utilisation of social media to provide institutional information or foster interactions with citizens. At the same time, European local governments are also starting to use social media for public service delivery.

AB The Internet and the development of the semantic web have created the opportunity to provide structured legal data on the web. However, most legal information is in text. It is difficult to automatically determine the right natural language answer about the law to a given natural language question. One approach is to develop systems of legal ontologies and rules. Our example ontology represents semantic information about USA criminal law and procedure as well as the applicable legal rules. The purpose of the ontology is to provide reasoning support to an legal question answering tool that determines entailment between a pair of texts, one known as the Background information (Bg) and the other Question statement (Q), whether Bg entails Q based on the application of the law. The key contribution of this paper is a clear and well-structured methodology that serves to develop such criminal law ontologies and rules (CLOR).

AB Banking and finance is a broad term that incorporates a variety of smaller, more specialized subjects such as corporate finance, tax finance, and insurance finance. A virtual assistant that assists users in searching for information about banking and finance terms might be an extremely beneficial tool for users. In this study, we explored the process of searching for information, seeking opportunities, and developing a virtual assistant in the first stages of starting learning and understanding Vietnamese to increase effectiveness and save time, which is also an innovative business practice in Use-case Vietnam. We built the FIBA2020 dataset and proposed a pipeline that used Natural Language Processing (NLP) inclusive of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to build chatbot applications. The open-source framework RASA is used to implement the system in our study. We aim to improve our model performance by replacing parts of RASA's default tokenizers with Vietnamese tokenizers and experimenting with various language models. The best accuracy we achieved is 86.48% and 70.04% in the ideal condition and worst condition, respectively. Finally, we put our findings into practice by creating an Android virtual assistant application using the model trained using Whitespace tokenizer and the pre-trained language m-BERT.

TI Beyond Transparency: The Semantics of Rulemaking for an Open Internet
SO INDIANA LAW JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID NET NEUTRALITY; ANTITRUST
AB In trying to promote the development of an open Internet, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has primarily tried to encourage network providers to be transparent about their traffic management practices and quality of service prioritization policies. Dominant network operators have successfully challenged this minimalist approach to addressing end-user concerns about the rise of a two-tiered Internet, motivating the FCC to engage in yet another public consultation process to assess its future approach to the problem. This article maps the debate using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools that allow us to build a systematic picture of the positions of the regulator and groups of private interests trying to shape its decisions. A quantitative linguistic analysis of the content of formal written submissions to the FCC by parties with divergent views helps document how the conceptual model of the regulator evolved during the rulemaking process leading to the FCC February 2015 network neutrality Order. Despite the adoption of a broader substantive basis by the FCC under Title II of the Communications Act, the rule-of-reason approach to substantive interpretation in the Order limits the capacity of the new regulatory framework to protect and promote an open Internet. The evidence suggests the public consultation process is likely to serve as a tool for legitimizing status quo institutional arrangements that allow operators to engage in discriminatory traffic prioritization strategies.

AB This paper presents a corpus of pre-processed Mexican laws for computational tasks. The main contributions are the proposed JSON structure and the methodology used to achieve the semi-structured corpus with the selected algorithms. Law PDF documents were transformed into plain text, unified by a deconstruction of law-document structure, and labeled with natural language processing techniques considering part of speech (PoS); a process of entity extraction was also performed. The corpus includes the Mexican constitution and the Mexican laws that were collected from the official site in PDF format repealed before 14 October 2021. The collection has 305 documents, including: the Mexican constitution, 289 laws, 8 federal codes, 3 regulations, 2 statutes, 1 decree, and 1 ordinance. The semi-structured database includes the transformation of the set of laws from PDF format to a digital representation in order to facilitate its computational analysis. The documents were migrated to JSON type files to represent internal hierarchical relations. In addition, basic natural language processing techniques were implemented on laws for the identification of part of speech and named entities. The presented data set is mainly useful for text analysis and data science. It could be used for various legislative analysis tasks including: comprehension, interpretation, translation, classification, accessibility, coherence, and searches. Finally, we present some statistic of the identified entities and an example of the usefulness of the corpus for environmental laws.

AB In a series of articles, Fine (Monist 83:357-361, 2000; Mind 112:195-234, 2003; Mind 115:1059-1082, 2006) presents some highly compelling objections to monism, the doctrine that spatially coincident objects are identical. His objections rely on Leibniz's Law and linguistic environments that appear to be immune to the standard charge of non-transparency and substitution failure. In this paper, I respond to Fine's objections on behalf of the monist. Following Schnieder (Philosophical Quarterly 56:39-54, 2006), I observe that arguments from Leibniz's Law are valid only if they involve descriptive, rather than metalinguistic, negation. Then I show that the monist is justified in treating the negation in Fine's objections as metalinguistic in nature. Along the way I make a few methodological remarks about the interaction between the study of natural language and metaphysics. I also present evidence that some of the linguistic environments which Fine relies on are, contrary to appearances, non-transparent.

AB With the appearance of many wearable devices like smartwatches, recording glasses (such as Google glass), smart phones, digital personal profiles have become more readily available nowadays. However, searching and navigating these multi-source, multi-modal, and often unstructured data to extract useful information is still a relatively challenging task. Therefore, the LSC2019 competition has been organized so that researchers can demonstrate novel search engines, as well as exchange ideas and collaborate on these types of problems. We present in this paper our approach for supporting interactive searches of lifelog data by employing a new retrieval system called VieLens, which is an interactive retrieval system enhanced by natural language processing techniques to extend and improve search results mainly in the context of a user's activities in their daily life.

AB Prostitution has been a topic of study for decades, yet many questions remain about where prostitution occurs. Difficulty in identifying prostitution activity is often attributed to the hidden and seemingly victimless nature of the crime. Despite numerous challenges associated with policing street prostitution, these encounters become more difficult to identify when they take place indoors, especially in locations away from public view, such as hotels. The purpose of this paper is to develop a strategy for identifying hotel facilities and surrounding areas that may be experiencing elevated levels of prostitution activity using high-volume, user-generated data, namely hotel reviews written by guests and posted to Travelocity.com. A unique synthesis of methods including data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and basic spatial analysis are combined to identify facilities that may require additional law enforcement resources and/or social/health service outreach. Prostitution hotspots are identified within the city of Phoenix, Arizona and policy implications are discussed.

AB Big data analytics can be used by smart cities to improve their citizens' liveability, health, and wellbeing. Social surveys and also social media can be employed to engage with their communities, and these can require sophisticated analysis techniques. This research was focused on carrying out a sentiment analysis from social surveys. Data analysis techniques using RStudio and Python were applied to several open-source datasets, which included the 2018 Social Indicators Survey dataset published by the City of Melbourne (CoM) and the Casey Next short survey 2016 dataset published by the City of Casey (CoC). The qualitative nature of the CoC dataset responses could produce rich insights using sentiment analysis, unlike the quantitative CoM dataset. RStudio analysis created word cloud visualizations and bar charts for sentiment values. These were then used to inform social media analysis via the Twitter application programming interface. The R codes were all integrated within a Shiny application to create a set of user-friendly interactive web apps that generate sentiment analysis both from the historic survey data and more immediately from the Twitter feeds. The web apps were embedded within a website that provides a customisable solution to estimate sentiment for key issues. Global sentiment was also compared between the social media approach and the 2016 survey dataset analysis and showed some correlation, although there are caveats on the use of social media for sentiment analysis. Further refinement of the methodology is required to improve the social media app and to calibrate it against analysis of recent survey data.

AB Legal texts are often difficult to interpret, and people who interpret them need to make choices about the interpretation. To improve transparency, the interpretation of a legal text can be made explicit by formalising it. However, creating formalised representations of legal texts manually is quite labour-intensive. In this paper, we describe a method to extract structured representations in the Flint language (van Doesburg and van Engers, 2019) from natural language. Automated extraction of knowledge representation not only makes the interpretation and modelling efforts more efficient, it also contributes to reducing inter-coder dependencies. The Flint language offers a formal model that enables the interpretation of legal text by describing the norms in these texts as acts, facts and duties. To extract the components of a Flint representation, we use a rule-based method and a transformer-based method. In the transformer-based method we fine-tune the last layer with annotated legal texts. The results show that the transformed-based method (80% accuracy) outperforms the rule-based method (42% accuracy) on the Dutch Aliens Act. This indicates that the transformer-based method is a promising approach of automatically extracting Flint frames.

AB This work presents a platform for linked legislative data to engage citizens in transparent and effective democracies. With a focus on scaling up participatory approaches from local to national level, the approach extends well established and open source tools and technologies, to build mobile monitoring and analysis tools that increase transparency of law-making and implementation to citizens. This is achieved by combining open data and open services with user and citizen generated content, in order to address citizen's needs in the context of open government. Data and feeds from trusted sources are interconnected with new and re-purposed data feeds generated by users via the social web to form a meaningful, searchable, customizable, re-usable and open data-focused personalised mobile public service approach. The framework exploits the social aspects of open data, as well as the training of users, citizens and public servants to be able to understand and demand useful public open data, as well as facilitate the opening of more data.

DE Conversational agent; Dialog systems; Dialogue corpora;
   Cyber-pedophilia; Natural language processing
AB A conversational agent, also known as chatbot, is a machine conversational system which interacts with human users via natural language. Traditionally, chatbot technology is built under certain set of "manually" elaborated conversational rules. However, given the availability of large and real examples of humans' interactions in the web, automatically generating these rules is becoming a more feasible option. In this paper we describe an approach for building and training a conversational agent, which holds a teenager personality and it is able to dialogue in Mexican Spanish. By means of this chatter bot we aim at assisting law enforcement officers in the prevention of cyber-pedophilia. Our performed experiments demonstrate that our developed chatbot is able to elaborate comparable lexical and syntactical constructions to those a teenager would produce. As an additional contribution, we compile and release a large dialogue corpus containing real examples of conversations among teenagers.

AB A growing body of scholarly work underscores that the relationship between women's political representation and quality of government is stronger in democracies than in authoritarian regimes. The relationship, however, is less clear in regimes that are neither fully-fledged democratic nor authoritarian. I investigate the gender gap in representatives' efforts to push for improvements in the quality of government in the local councils of Albania following the implementation of gender quotas in 2015. Using the transcripts of council meetings, I identify the kind of practices that councilors challenge when holding local government officials to account, and I compare women with men. The study shows that councilors contest practices that concern law enforcement, impartiality, and transparency. Women, compared to men, are more likely to contest practices that concern transparency. The greatest gender gap is observed in councils where the implementation of gender quotas has disrupted male dominance, numerically speaking, the most.

AB Objective Analyze responses to a national request for information (RFI) to uncover gaps in policy, practice, and understanding of veteran suicide to inform federal research strategy. Data source An RFI with 21 open-ended questions generated from Presidential Executive Order #1386, administered nationally from July 3 to August 5, 2019. Study design Semi-structured, open-ended responses analyzed using a collaborative qualitative and text-mining data process. Data extraction methods We aligned traditional qualitative methods with natural language processing (NLP) text-mining techniques to analyze 9040 open-ended question responses from 722 respondents to provide results within 3 months. Narrative inquiry and the medical explanatory model guided the data extraction and analytic process. Results Five major themes were identified: risk factors, risk assessment, prevention and intervention, barriers to care, and data/research. Individuals and organizations mentioned different concepts within the same themes. In responses about risk factors, individuals frequently mentioned generic terms like "illness" while organizations mentioned specific terms like "traumatic brain injury." Organizations and individuals described unique barriers to care and emphasized ways to integrate data and research to improve points of care. Organizations often identified lack of funding as barriers while individuals often identified key moments for prevention such as military transitions and ensuring care providers have military cultural understanding. Conclusions This study provides an example of a rapid, adaptive analysis of a large body of qualitative, public response data about veteran suicide to support a federal strategy for an important public health topic. Combining qualitative and text-mining methods allowed a representation of voices and perspectives including the lived experiences of individuals who described stories of military transition, treatments that worked or did not, and the perspective of organizations treating veterans for suicide. The results supported the development of a national strategy to reduce suicide risks for veterans as well as civilians.

AB European Law Enforcement Agencies are increasingly more reliant on information and communication technologies and are affected by a society shaped by the Internet and social media. The richness and quantity of information available from open sources, if properly gathered and processed, can provide valuable intelligence and help drawing inference from existing closed source intelligence. CAPER is an Open Source INTelligence platform for the prevention of organized crime, created in cooperation with European LEAs. CAPER supports information sharing and multi-modal analysis of open and closed information sources, mainly based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Visual Analytics (VA) technologies.

TI Toward Automatically Generating Privacy Policy for Android Apps
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
LA English
DT Article
DE Mobile applications; natural language processing; privacy policy; static
   code analysis
AB A privacy policy is a statement informing users how their information will be collected, used, and disclosed. Failing to provide a correct privacy policy may result in a fine. However, writing privacy policy is tedious and error-prone, because the author may not understand the source code well as it could have been written by others (e.g., outsourcing), or the author does not know the internal working of third-party libraries used. In this paper, we propose and develop a novel system named AutoPPG to automatically construct correct and readable descriptions to facilitate the generation of privacy policy for Android applications (i.e., apps). Given an app, AutoPPG first conducts static code analysis to characterize its behaviors related to users' personal information, and then applies natural language processing techniques to generating correct and accessible sentences for describing these behaviors. The experimental results using real apps and crowdsourcing indicate that: 1) AutoPPG creates correct and easy-to-understand descriptions for privacy policies; 2) the privacy policies constructed by AutoPPG usually reveal more operations related to users' personal information than existing privacy policies; and 3) most developers, who reply us, would like to use AutoPPG to facilitate them.

AB This paper describes the automated classification of legal norms in German statutes with regard to their semantic type. We propose a semantic type taxonomy for norms in the German civil law domain consisting of nine different types focusing on functional aspects, such as Duties, Prohibitions, Permissions, etc. We performed four iterations in classifying legal norms with a rule-based approach using a manually labeled dataset, i.e., tenancy law, of the German Civil Code (n = 601). During this experiment the F-1 score continuously improved from 0.52 to 0.78. In contrast, a machine learning based approach for the classification was implemented. A performance of F-1 = 0.83 was reached. Traditionally, machine learning classifiers lack of transparency with regard to their decisions. We extended our approach using so-called local linear approximations, which is a novel technique to analyze and inspect a trained classifier's behavior. We can show that there are significant similarities of manually crafted knowledge, i.e., rules and pattern definitions, and the trained decision structures of machine learning approaches.

AB Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.

AB Modern means of communication, economic crises, and political decisions play imperative roles in reshaping political and administrative systems throughout the world. Twitter, a micro-blogging website, has gained paramount importance in terms of public opinion-sharing. Manual intelligence of law enforcement agencies (i.e., in changing situations) cannot cope in real time. Thus, to address this problem, we built an alert system for government authorities in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The alert system gathers real-time data from Twitter in English and Roman Urdu about forthcoming gatherings (protests, demonstrations, assemblies, rallies, sit-ins, marches, etc.). To determine public sentiment regarding upcoming anti-government gatherings (protests, demonstrations, assemblies, rallies, sit-ins, marches, etc.), the alert system determines the polarity of tweets. Using keywords, the system provides information for future gatherings by extracting the entities like date, time, and location from Twitter data obtained in real time. Our system was trained and tested with different machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), multinomial naive Bayes (MNB), and Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), along with two vectorization techniques, i.e., term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) and count vectorization. Moreover, this paper compares the accuracy results of sentiment analysis (SA) of Twitter data by applying supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. In our research experiment, we used two data sets, i.e., a small data set of 1000 tweets and a large data set of 4000 tweets. Results showed that RF along with count vectorization performed best for the small data set with an accuracy of 82%; with the large data set, MNB along with count vectorization outperformed all other classifiers with an accuracy of 75%. Additionally, language models, e.g., bigram and trigram, were used to generate the word clouds of positive and negative words to visualize the most frequently used words.

AB We investigated the course of language processing in the context of a verification task that required numerical estimation and comparison. Participants listened to sentences with complex quantifiers that contrasted in Polarity, a logical property (e.g., more-than-half, less-than-half), and then performed speeded verification on visual scenarios that displayed a proportion between 2 discrete quantities. We varied systematically not only the sentences, but also the visual materials, in order to study their effect on the verification process. Next, we used the same visual scenarios with analogous non-verbal probes that featured arithmetical inequality symbols (<, >). This manipulation enabled us to measure not only Polarity effects, but also, to compare the effect of different probe types (linguistic, non-linguistic) on processing.
   Like many previous studies, our results demonstrate that perceptual difficulty affects error rate and reaction time in keeping with Weber's Law. Interestingly, these performance parameters are also affected by the Polarity of the quantifiers used, despite the fact that sentences had the exact same meaning, sentence structure, number of words, syllables, and temporal structure. Moreover, an analogous contrast between the non-linguistic probes (<, >) had no effect on performance. Finally, we observed no interaction between performance parameters governed by Weber's Law and those affected by Polarity. We consider 4 possible accounts of the results (syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, frequency-based), and discuss their relative merit. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The research field of legal profession includes related legal features of computer evidence and its recognition process thereof. Evidence technical features and acquisition techniques thereof are researched and calculated from technical angle in computer field. Since forensic discipline belongs to an inter-discipline established on the basis of law and computer science. It should be researched from the perspective of the two disciplines and specialty embodied on the derived disciplines thereof. In the paper, effectiveness of economic contract and risk consultation during performance are proposed, and legal expert system design model for legal retrieval is established with limited natural language. The system is realized with blackboard model. A knowledge expression method applicable for legal field is also proposed. Law is combined with computer technology for researching computer forensics. Related legal issues of computer forensics are described. Technical methods and tools for computer forensics are mainly researched, and a technical process of computer forensics experiment is provided. Current related laws and regulations of computer forensics and disadvantages of computer forensics technology are proposed. Keys of exchange safety under network environment are discussed with information exchange theory. Existing information laws are analyzed. Establishment of new network safe legal system is proposed from the perspective of information exchange Finally, the system is designed and realized, and key issues are studied.

AB The documentation that describes the regulations within a Society, is oriented towards specific areas. This fact does not prevent maintaining concordance in the temporality and transversality of the documents. This work defines the concept of "opposition relations " in legal texts. We identify entities and evaluate the polarity of each paragraph with sentiment analysis techniques. If an entity appears in different paragraphs (articles of law) with opposite polarities, we evaluate the entity's contexts. We look for antonyms between the words that give polarity to the opposite paragraphs. If there is an antonymic relation in words associated with the entity, we have an opposition relation. The described methodology analyzes the relationship of entities in Mexican Environmental Laws, and the study is oriented towards coherence in the legislation for sustainable development. This process was implemented by computational processing, which required the transformation of current Mexican laws, unifying its structure. Eight environmental laws were analyzed, 1920 entities were identified that appear more than once; 44 of them were identified with opposite polarities, due to their context, a detailed analysis of two cases with potential opposite relationships is exemplified.

AB News articles capture a variety of topics about our society. They reflect not only the socioeconomic activities that happened in our physical world, but also some of the cultures, human interests, and public concerns that exist only in the perceptions of people. Cities are frequently mentioned in news articles, and two or more cities may co-occur in the same article. Such co-occurrence often suggests certain relatedness between the mentioned cities, and the relatedness may be under different topics depending on the contents of the news articles. We consider the relatedness under different topics as semantic relatedness. By reading news articles, one can grasp the general semantic relatedness between cities; yet, given hundreds of thousands of news articles, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to manually read them. This paper proposes a computational framework which can read' a large number of news articles and extract the semantic relatedness between cities. This framework is based on a natural language processing model and employs a machine learning process to identify the main topics of news articles. We describe the overall structure of this framework and its individual modules, and then apply it to an experimental dataset with more than 500,000 news articles covering the top 100 US cities spanning a 10-year period. We perform exploratory visualizations of the extracted semantic relatedness under different topics and over multiple years. We also analyze the impact of geographic distance on semantic relatedness and find varied distance decay effects. The proposed framework can be used to support large-scale content analysis in city network research.

AB In a workshop organized in December 2017 in Leiden, the Netherlands, a group of lawyers, computer scientists, artists, activists and social and cultural scientists collectively read a computer science paper about 'improving fairness'. This session was perceived by many participants as eye-opening on how different epistemologies shape approaches to the problem, method and solutions, thus enabling further cross-disciplinary discussions during the rest of the workshop. For many participants it was both refreshing and challenging, in equal measure, to understand how another discipline approached the problem of fairness. Now, as a follow-up we propose a translation tutorial that will engage participants at the FAT* conference in a similar exercise. We will invite participants to work in small groups reading excerpts of academic papers from different disciplinary perspectives on the same theme. We argue that most of us do not read outside our disciplines and thus are not familiar with how the same issues might be framed and addressed by our peers. Thus the purpose will be to have participants reflect on the different genealogies of knowledge in research, and how they erect walls, or generate opportunities for more productive inter-disciplinary work. We argue that addressing, through technical measures or otherwise, matters of ethics, bias and discrimination in AI/ML technologies in society is complicated by the different constructions of knowledge about what ethics (or bias or discrimination) means to different groups of practitioners. In the current academic structure, there are scarce resources to test, build on-or even discard-methods to talk across disciplinary lines. This tutorial is thus proposed to see if this particular method might work.

DE data management plan; data protection; anonymisation; personal data
AB The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 27 April 2016 will apply from 25 May 2018. It will reinforce certain principles related to the processing of personal data, which will also affect many projects in the field of Natural Language Processing. Perhaps most importantly, the GDPR will introduce the principle of accountability, according to which the data processor shall be able to demonstrate compliance with the new rules, and that he applies `privacy by design and by default'. In our opinion, a well-drafted Data Management Plan (DMP) is of key importance for GDPR compliance; indeed, the trend towards the adoption of a DMP, particularly in EU-funded research projects, has been more vivid since 2017, after the extension of the Horizon 2020 Open Data Pilot. Since 2015, ELRA also proposes its own template for the Data Management Plan, which is being updated to take the new law into account. In this paper, we present the new legal framework introduced by the GDPR and propose how the new rules can be integrated in the DMP in order to increase transparency of processing, facilitate demonstration of GDPR compliance and spread good practices within the community.

ID INFORMATION
AB This paper presents a study on analyzing questions in legal domain for Vietnamese language, which is an important step in building an automated question answering system for the domain. We focus on questions about transportation law - the law with arguably the largest number of violations and thus is the most asked about. Given a legal question in natural language, our goal is to extract important information such as Type of Vehicle, Action of Vehicle, Location, and Question Type. We model the question analysis task as a sequence labeling problem and present a CRF-based method to deal with it. Experimental results on a corpus consisting of 1678 Vietnamese questions show that our method can extract 16 types of information with high precision and recall.

AB We compared entropy for texts written in natural languages (English, Spanish) and artificial languages (computer software) based on a simple expression for the entropy as a function of message length and specific word diversity. Code text written in artificial languages showed higher entropy than text of similar length expressed in natural languages. Spanish texts exhibit more symbolic diversity than English ones. Results showed that algorithms based on complexity measures differentiate artificial from natural languages, and that text analysis based on complexity measures allows the unveiling of important aspects of their nature. We propose specific expressions to examine entropy related aspects of tests and estimate the values of entropy, emergence, self-organization, and complexity based on specific diversity and message length.

AB Despite extensive empirical evidence of the environmental benefits of green buildings and the increasing urgency to reduce carbon emissions in cities, there has been limited widespread adoption of energy retrofit investments in existing buildings. In this paper, we empirically model financial returns to energy retrofit investments for more than 3600 multifamily and commercial buildings in New York City, using a comprehensive database of energy audits and renovation work extracted from city records using a natural language processing algorithm. Based on auditor cost and savings estimates, the median internal rate of return for adopted energy conservation measures is 21% for multifamily buildings and 25% for office properties. Logistic regression modeling demonstrates adoption rates are higher for office buildings than multifamily, and in both cases adopter buildings tend to be larger, higher value, and less energy efficient prior to retrofit implementation. The economically significant magnitudes of returns to adopted energy conservation measures raise important questions about why many property owners choose not to adopt. As such, we discuss incentive and regulatory mechanisms that can overcome financial and informational barriers to the adoption of energy efficiency measures.

   General Data Protection Regulation
AB The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has compelled businesses and other organizations to update their privacy policies to state specific information about their data practices. Simultaneously, researchers in natural language processing (NLP) have developed corpora and annotation schemes for extracting salient information from privacy policies, often independently of specific laws. To connect existing NLP research on privacy policies with the GDPR, we introduce a mapping from GDPR provisions to the OPP-115 annotation scheme, which serves as the basis for a growing number of projects to automatically classify privacy policy text. We show that assumptions made in the annotation scheme about the essential topics for a privacy policy reflect many of the same topics that the GDPR requires in these documents. This suggests that OPP-115 continues to be representative of the anatomy of a legally compliant privacy policy, and that the legal assumptions behind it represent the elements of data processing that ought to be disclosed within a policy for transparency. The correspondences we show between OPP-115 and the GDPR suggest the feasibility of bridging existing computational and legal research on privacy policies, benefiting both areas.

AB Recent research shows that algorithms learn societal biases from large text corpora. We examine the marketplace-relevant consequences of such bias for consumers. Based on billions of documents from online text corpora, we first demonstrate that from gender biases embedded in language, algorithms learn to associate women with more negative consumer psychographic attributes than men (e.g., associating women more closely with impulsive vs. planned investors). Second, in a series of field experiments, we show that such learning results in the delivery of gender-biased digital advertisements and product recommendations. Specifically, across multiple platforms, products, and attributes, we find that digital advertisements containing negative psychographic attributes (e.g., impulsive) are more likely to be delivered to women compared to men, and that search engine product recommendations are similarly biased, which influences consumer's consideration sets and choice. Finally, we empirically examine consumer's role in co-producing algorithmic gender bias in the marketplace and observe that consumers reinforce these biases by accepting gender stereotypes (i.e., clicking on biased ads). We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical implications.

AB Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) is the native language of people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (D/HH) in Brazil and it does not replace the Brazilian-Portuguese written language. Considering this fact provided by law, in 2017, the High School National Exam (ENEM), an exam organized by governmental education sector for people to ingress in undergraduate programs, first offered the video-exam in Libras for D/HH candidates to access contents in Libras. The video-exam can be considered as an Assistive Technology product, since it may enable D/HH students' autonomy by displaying contents in their natural language. A framework for adoption of an Assistive Technology is under validation through a case study co-designed with stakeholders, in which this investigation is part of the process. In this paper we show requirements and main questions categorized in six levels of the Semiotic Ladder artifact and, from it, we define the group who are the most important stakeholders that have to participate in futures semio-participatory workshops.

AB In recent years, the problem of data leakage often appears in our lives. As of today, a number of enterprises have been fined heavily for the leakage of user data, including Facebook, Uber and Equifax. This paper makes deep research on the privacy protection of the text. We proposed a three-layer privacy protection mechanism for carrying out privacy-preserving text perturbation. This approach allows different levels of privacy protection for different parts of the text, thereby increasing the level of privacy protection without reducing utility. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed method not only provides fine-grained control over the level of privacy in that data but also improves performance.

AB Job seekers find themselves increasingly duped and misled by fraudulent job advertisements, posing a threat to their privacy, security and well-being. There is a clear need for solutions that can protect innocent job seekers. Existing approaches to detecting fraudulent jobs do not scale well, function like a black-box, and lack interpretability, which is essential to guide applicants' decision-making. Moreover, commonly used lexical features may be insufficient as the representation does not capture contextual semantics of the underlying document. Hence, this paper explores to what extent different categorizations of fraudulent jobs can be classified. In addition, this paper seeks to find what type of features are most relevant in classifying the type of fraudulent job. In this paper, we develop and validate a machine learning system for identifying identity theft, corporate identity theft and multi-level marketing amongst fraudulent job advertisements. We utilized four classes of features: empirical rule set-based features, bag-of-word models, most recent state-of-the-art word embeddings and transformer models for various machine learning classifiers. The machine learning models were validated by evaluating them on a publicly available job description dataset. Our results indicate that the word embeddings and transformer-based features consistently outperformed the handcrafted rule-set based features class. Ultimately, a Gradient Boosting classifier with a combination of empirical rule-set based features, parts-of-speech tags and bag-of-words vectors achieved the best performance with an F1-score of 0.88.

ID DEVELOPMENT GOALS
AB Surprisingly little is known about agenda setting for international development in the United Nations (UN), despite it having a significant influence on the process and outcomes of development efforts. This paper addresses this shortcoming using a novel approach that applies natural language processing techniques to countries' annual statements in the UN General Debate. Every year UN member states deliver statements during the General Debate on their governments' perspective on major issues in world politics. These speeches provide invaluable information on state preferences on a wide range of issues, including international development, but have largely been overlooked in the study of global politics. This paper identifies the main international development topics that states raise in these speeches between 1970 and 2016, and examine the country-specific drivers of international development rhetoric.

AB The rapid popularity of government social media has generated huge amounts of text data, and the analysis of these data has gradually become the focus of digital government research. This study uses Python language to analyze the big data of the Chinese provincial government Weibo. First, this study uses a web crawler approach to collect and statistically describe over 360,000 data from 31 provincial government microblogs in China, covering the period from January 2018 to April 2022. Second, a word separation engine is constructed and these text data are analyzed using word cloud word frequencies as well as semantic relationships. Finally, the text data were analyzed for sentiment using natural language processing methods, and the text topics were studied using LDA algorithm. The results of this study show that, first, the number and scale of posts on the Chinese government Weibo have grown rapidly. Second, government Weibo has certain social attributes, and the epidemics, people's livelihood, and services have become the focus of government Weibo. Third, the contents of government Weibo account for more than 30% of negative sentiments. The classified topics show that the epidemics and epidemic prevention and control overshadowed the other topics, which inhibits the diversification of government Weibo.

AB Neural network-based approaches have become the driven forces for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Conventionally, there are two mainstream neural architectures for NLP tasks: the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the convolution neural network (ConvNet). RNNs are good at modeling long-term dependencies over input texts, but preclude parallel computation. ConvNets do not have memory capability and it has to model sequential data as un-ordered features. Therefore, ConvNets fail to learn sequential dependencies over the input texts, but it is able to carry out high-efficient parallel computation. As each neural architecture, such as RNN and ConvNets, has its own pro and con, integration of different architectures is assumed to be able to enrich the semantic representation of texts, thus enhance the performance of NLP tasks. However, few investigation explores the reconciliation of these seemingly incompatible architectures. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid architecture based on a novel hierarchical multi-granularity attention mechanism, named Multi-granularity Attention-based Hybrid Neural Network (MahNN). The attention mechanism is to assign different weights to different parts of the input sequence to increase the computation efficiency and performance of neural models. In MahNN, two types of attentions are introduced: the syntactical attention and the semantical attention. The syntactical attention computes the importance of the syntactic elements (such as words or sentence) at the lower symbolic level and the semantical attention is used to compute the importance of the embedded space dimension corresponding to the upper latent semantics. We adopt the text classification as an exemplifying way to illustrate the ability of MahNN to understand texts. The experimental results on a variety of datasets demonstrate that MahNN outperforms most of the state-of-the-arts for text classification.

AB Computers have undergone tremendous improvements in performance over the last 60 years, but those improvements have significantly slowed down over the last decade, owing to fundamental limits in the underlying computing primitives. However, the generation of data and demand for computing are increasing exponentially with time. Thus, there is a critical need to invent new computing primitives, both hardware and algorithms, to keep up with the computing demands. The brain is a natural computer that outperforms our best computers in solving certain problems, such as instantly identifying faces or understanding natural language. This realization has led to a flurry of research into neuromorphic or brain-inspired computing that has shown promise for enhanced computing capabilities. This review points to the important primitives of a brain-inspired computer that could drive another decade-long wave of computer engineering.

AB Delineating urban functional use plays a key role in understanding urban dynamics, evaluating planning strategies and supporting policymaking. In recent years, Points of Interest (POI) data, with precise geolocation and detailed attributes, have become the primary data source for exploring urban functional use from a bottom-up perspective, using local, highly disaggregated, big datasets. Previous studies using POI data have given insufficient consideration to the relationship among POI classes in the spatial context, and have failed to provide a straightforward means by which to classify urban functional areas. This study proposes an approach for delineating urban functional use at the scale of the Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) in Greater London by integrating the Doc2Vec model, a neural network embedding method commonly used in natural language processing for vectoring words and documents from their context. In this study, the neural network vectorises both POI classes ('Word') and urban areas ('Document') based on their functional context by learning features from the spatial distribution of POIs in the city. Specifically, we first construct POI sequences based on the distribution of POI classes, and add their LSOA IDs as 'document' tags. By utilising these constructed POI-LSOA sequences, the Doc2Vec model trains the vectors of 574 POI classes (word vectors) and 4836 LSOAs (document vectors). The vectors of POI classes are then used in calculating the functional similarity scores based on their cosine distance, with the vectors of LSOAs grouped into clusters (i.e., functional areas) via the k-means clustering algorithm. We also identify latent functions in each cluster of LSOAs by performing topic modelling and enrichment factor. Compared with TF-IDF, LDA and Word2Vec models, the Doc2Vec model obtains the highest accuracy when classifying functional areas. This study proposes a straightforward approach in which the model directly trains vectors for urban areas, subsequently using them to classify urban functional areas. By employing the enhanced neural network model with low-cost and ubiquitous POI datasets, this study provides a potential tool with which to monitor urban dynamics in a timely and adaptive manner, thereby providing enhanced, datadriven support to urban planning, development and management.

AB This paper investigates the effect of a new bus route on noise complaints of residents and the influence of noise on housing price. To overcome the challenge of mapping noise data with subjective emotion, we use a novel data source-text-based noise complaint records from residents in a town in Singapore-and apply natural language processing tools to conduct sentiment analysis. To address the endogeneity concern regarding the bus route, we use a hypothetical least cost path as an instrument for the existing bus route. We find that living closer to the bus route for every 100 m increases noise complaints by around 10 percentage points, and the effect is more severe on medium floor levels (5th-8th floors) and near bus stops (within 100 m). We further link noise with housing price and discover a price reduction of 3% with a 1-scale-point increase in noise complaints. This implies that bus noise offsets 17.8% of the benefit from convenience, which sheds light on the importance of noise insulation in transit-oriented developments.

AB This paper presents an approach for intelligent tutoring in the field of legal argumentation. In this approach, students study transcripts of US Supreme Court oral argument and create a graphical representation of argument flow as tests offered by attorneys being challenged by hypotheticals posed by Justices. The proposed system, which is based on the collaborative modeling framework Cool Modes, is capable of detecting three types of weaknesses in arguments; when it does, it presents the student with a self explanation prompt. This kind of feedback seems more appropriate than the "strong connective feedback" typically offered by model-tracing or constraint-based tutors. Structural and context weaknesses in arguments are handled by graph grammars, and the critical problem of detecting and dealing with content weaknesses in student contributions is addressed through a collaborative filtering approach, thereby avoiding the critical problem of natural language processing in legal argumentation. An early version of the system was pilot tested with two students.

AB Assuring the quality, consistency and accuracy of safety data repositories is essential in safety-critical systems. In many systems, however, significant effort is required to identify, address, clean and repair data errors and inconsistencies, and to integrate safety data sets and repositories, particularly for risk analyses. Although some self healing and self repairing capabilities leveraging machine learning and predictive analyses have been employed to identify anomalies and monitor quality in structured safety-critical data sets, little attention has been focused on addressing shortcomings in heterogeneous structured and unstructured safety data sets, the focus of this work. The text mining and classification analysis employed in this research indicates that machine learning techniques can be employed to improve the accuracy and robustness of large-scale structured and unstructured database repositories, and to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of safety data repository maintenance. Hybrid machine learning approaches, leveraging machine learning, text mining and natural language processing, offer additional promise in future work.

TI An Effective Approach to Input Variable Selection for Preliminary Cost
   Estimation of Construction Projects
SO ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English

ID FUZZY AHP; ACCURACY; TOPSIS; MODEL
AB Accurate cost estimates are vital to the effective realisation of construction projects. Extended knowledge, wide-ranging information, substantial expertise, and continuous improvement are required to attain accurate cost estimation. Cost estimation at the preliminary phase of the project is always a challenge as only limited information is available. Hence, rational selection of input variables for preliminary cost estimation could be imperative. A systematic input variable selection approach for preliminary estimating using an integrated methodology of factor analysis and fuzzy AHP is presented in this paper. First, the factor analysis is used to classify and reduce the input variables and their variable coefficients are determined. Second, fuzzy AHP based on the geometric mean method is employed to determine the weights of input variables in a fuzzy environment where the subjectivity and vagueness are handled with natural language expressions parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, the input variables are suggested to be selected starting with those having high coefficient and high importance weight. A set of three variables, one from each group, can be added to the estimating model at a time so that the problem of collinearity can vanish and good accuracy of the estimate can be ensured. The proposed approach enables cost estimators to better understand the complete input variable selection process at the early stage of project development and provide a more accurate, rational, and systematic decision support tool.

AB This paper explores how discourse markers contribute to the update of discourse through a detailed study of Mandarin dique 'indeed' and zhende 'really'. On the basis of empirical data and a naturalness rating experiment, we show that dique and zhende make similar yet different contributions to discourse updates. Dique presupposes that its prejacent issue is old, while zhende presupposes that its prejacent issue is old and that some discourse participant has failed to resolve this issue. Furthermore, dique and zhende can embed both assertions and questions. This supports Farkas and Bruce's (2010) Table stack model, which provides a uniform treatment for assertions and questions.

AB Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64 years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations. Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150 minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant. Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5 points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
   Background: Tourism represents 45% gross domestic product in Balearic Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication, poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10 semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS: 1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7 years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7). HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2% (IC 95% 65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9% (IC 95% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands; 55.3% (IC 95% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6% and 35.1% self-reported regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker than women from the same social class do.
   Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51%), repetitive and having a severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost. Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection. Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge, improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least 20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months. In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults: Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There was a 63.5% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion: Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV in primary care.
   Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented. Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results: First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000 unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population. Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics, drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
   Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort included 561 patients, women were 56%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03) years and 31.5% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were 54%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV, saturation of oxygen lower than 90% or an increase in the dyspnoea at the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart failure decompensation.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial: qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data. Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31 CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate, compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and 11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We identified the constructs that explain the variation in the effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut), Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes: Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5%) were lost to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
   Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP) frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP, proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of 2733 (11%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7% for 14 intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED. Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93%, in 6% of the cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention. More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
   Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll. Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical, psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy) through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial, conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona. Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188, PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10 hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity. Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369 enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0%) provided data at the three months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2%) at 12 months. Mean age of study subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2% were women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at work.
   Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need. This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice. The stability of policies for community participation in primary healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of exclusion whereby so-called 'hard to reach' groups are not adequately involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice. This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community participation in primary healthcare, for all.
   Background: Community participation is essential for effective implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete collaboration and communication between communities and other parties involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods: Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers, collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers, champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members, patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion: Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal, synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating findings into appropriate actions.
   Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial, implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones. Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension, socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population, albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate and culturally adapt decision aids.
   What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care, Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms, the value is the perception that people have about clinical effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response, we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model: 1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5. Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6. Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality of community life, political systems require economic, housing, education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health. 2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their actions to the social reality of each territory.
   Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results: Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old increased by 70% vs. a 2% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region. Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19% in Borgholm vs. 9% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital care episodes decreased 7% in Borgholm vs. 13% increase for the rest of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8% in Borgholm vs. 21% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75 years old decreased 4% in Borgholm vs. a 10% increase for the rest of Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural Swedish jurisdiction.
   Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a critical role for early identification and care of patients with dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from 20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450 (3.5%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over 65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3%) followed by vascular dementia 27.11%. The average age of respondents in the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50% patients under the age of 79 years, 65.6% were female and 68.4% were with elementary school. In the entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3%) said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor was hypertension (85.1%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic attacks (29.3%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4% of patients had high levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8%) acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77 (17.1%) memantine, while 247 (54.9%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4%) reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the majority of these patients (more than 50%) the reason for not receiving therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6%). Conclusion: This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare needs people with dementia.
   Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills is certain. Research question: 'What is the emotional experience of second and third-year medical students during their first clinical internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12 students in their second or third year of medical training at the University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often ignored and was not taken into account in the development of professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher. Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion: Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
   Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years 2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as 'good medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5%) were treated with apixaban, 6321 (24.3%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1%) were treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0%) were treated with dabigatran. Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9% for rivaroxaban, 84.9% for apixaban, 83.6% for dabigatran and 55.8% for warfarin (p<.0001). Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates (p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion: Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
   Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases. The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of 'unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95 had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166 patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by 7.6%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18%.
   Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A search equation using the following MeSH terms 'big data, data mining, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice, electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give their readers more confidence in Big Data.
   Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian. Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods: HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items. Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and 0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French version.
   Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners (GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients, patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations, barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group. Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12 patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention. Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures. GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared. Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change. Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another. Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.
